<p>An attempt is made, in this volume, to record some of the
more prominent features regarding Ice as it affects the health,
convenience and industry of the people.</p>

<p>The development of the ice industry during the last forty
years has been phenomenal; there are, however, but few records
by which its progress can be accurately gauged.</p>

<p>No pretentions, other than those of a practical character,
are made in behalf of this book. But it is hoped that the
information here collected will meet with the favor and
approval of those who are interested in this commodity.</p>

<p>The Origin of the Ice Business in the United States—Its Wonderful
Development Commercially and in the Manifold
Uses of Ice—A Pen Picture of a Modern Ice Harvest.</p>
</div>

<p>Prior to 1805, there was no regularly conducted traffic in
ice, in this country. In the winter of 1805–6, a supply was
secured at Boston, Mass., and the following summer a cargo
was despatched to the West Indies, where yellow fever was
then raging.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domestic and Export Trade</span> were both of very slow
growth, and, in 1825, the ice consumed in the United States
and exported to foreign ports was probably less than fifty
thousand tons. During the thirty years following, the consumption
of ice increased more rapidly, and the enterprise of
the shippers carried the fame of Boston ice all around the
world. Cargoes were consigned to London, to the East Indies,
and the West Indies, Rio de Janeiro, Calcutta, China, Japan,
and Australia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Export Trade</span> reached its height about this time.
Frederick Tudor, of Boston, Mass., who shipped the first cargo
to the West Indies in 1806, and whose enterprise had carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
his ships to all the ports mentioned, was titled the “Ice King.”
Not many years after this, ice and refrigerator machines
began to supply the demand for ice in tropical climes, and the
importations of the natural product soon ceased. Two million
tons is a liberal estimate of the amount of ice stored at this
date, 1855, in the United States, with six or seven million
dollars of invested capital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Many New Uses</span> for ice have exerted a marked influence
on the demand during the succeeding years. During the war
of the Rebellion, the Government was a large purchaser, on
account of the hospital service. The brewers, who in earlier
days, had suspended operations during the heat of the summer,
now pursued their avocation continuously, with the aid
of ice. Meat packers found in ice an agent for immensely
augmenting their product, while the fisheries consumed many
thousand tons.</p>

<p>The demand for ice creams and cooled drinks, together
with the growing taste for luxuries, in our cities and towns,
has stimulated the retailing of ice until, at this time, there is
hardly a town or village, where ice privileges exist, that does
not support a representative of the ice trade, and there are few
large towns in the South which are not furnished with one or
more artificial ice factories.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Use of Ice.</span>—It is safe to say that, at this time, the
users of ice, directly or indirectly, now include nearly the
entire population of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Development of Methods.</span>—The progress made in the
methods and conveniences for securing the natural ice crop,
and in the construction of storage houses, has kept pace with
the growth of the demand. Originally, axes and saws comprised
the dealers’ outfit. Now, a modern plant is replete with
tools and appliances, whose manufacture is a distinct calling,
and may comprise vessels, cars, wagons, immense storage
houses, where upward of one hundred thousand tons of ice are
gathered under one roof, also city supply depots and wharfs,
all of which are equipped with special regard to handling
this product.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Extent of the Ice Industry.</span>—The annual consumption
of natural and manufactured ice is very great. By adding to
this the equivalent, in tons of ice, of the work performed by
refrigerator machines, in the various industries in which they
are used, the grand total is estimated to exceed twenty million
tons of ice used each year.</p>

<p>The capital invested in carrying on this business is not less
than twenty-eight million dollars. Employment, constant and
temporary, is afforded by the ice trade to about ninety thousand
persons and twenty-five thousand horses.</p>

<p>It is probable that more than half of the world’s annual
ice supply is procured and consumed in this country, which is
the home of this industry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Preserving or Antiseptic Powers of Ice</span> have long
been made use of to keep food from decay. The best illustration
of its powers in this direction is found in the accounts
which travelers in Northern Europe and Asia have given us of
the discoveries of huge mammoths frozen within large blocks
of ice. This species of animal has been extinct for ages, and
so perfectly have they been preserved that some of the native
tribes occasionally make use of these supplies of flesh for food.
Fish, meat and eggs are now frozen and kept during many
months, and the transportation of fresh beef and mutton for
thousands of miles over land and sea is an established custom.
Fresh fish are frozen in the center of cakes of ice, and, shipped
in this way, present a very handsome appearance.</p>

<p>This property of ice for domestic and commercial purposes
has been of an incalculable benefit to the human family.
Many eminent physicians have laid the seal of their approval
upon the use of ice as a remedial agent, and also for the alleviation
of suffering among the sick. So highly did they esteem
it that, prior to the general introduction of the trade in ice,
many doctors and managers of hospitals had private stores of
ice for use among their patients. The directors of the Pennsylvania
hospital at Philadelphia may be credited with being
the pioneer ice dealers of that city, as in the early years of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
century they disposed of their surplus stores of ice by sale in
that community. Many localities which are now important
centers in the ice trade were at one time dependent upon the
medical fraternity for ice for hygienic purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pen Picture of a Modern Ice Harvest.</span> (See <a href="#i_frontis">Frontispiece</a>.)—Viewed
from an eminence on the shore, a pretty and
engaging scene is often presented at an ice house in the
country, during the harvest. The clear sunlight flooding the
quiet landscape discloses here and there a snug farmhouse
sheltered among the hills, and surrounded with trees and
shrubs, rivaling, in their soft downy draperies of spotless white
and brilliant pearls, their vernal beauty when joyous spring
has clothed their boughs with fragrant blossoms and emerald
leaves. The broad stream or lake, ice-locked and still,
stretches away to the distance, a level and unbroken plain; its
farther shore dwindling away until lost to view, presents a
delicately traced outline of forest and field against the horizon.
The near by shore stands out clear cut and bold of outline, but
quiet and deserted. Nothing in the aspect of nature denotes
activity or invites the attack of man by a display of treasure.</p>

<p>Stepping to the brink of the hill near the shore, a new
scene breaks upon the view. At the foot of the hill stands a
huge ice house, its shore side serried with galleries along the
entire front, with inclined ways extending from the water to
the top of the house, and a connecting bridge or runway
between each gallery and the incline. Alongside of the incline
is discovered a power-house and tool-room, and at a little distance
large barns and dwellings. From the foot of the incline
leading out into the lake is seen a dark line, which branches
out and becomes a large blot on the clear white surface. A
closer inspection reveals an animated scene, of men armed
with strange weapons attacking, with great vigor, fields of ice,
which they detach from the main surface, and on which they
navigate the open water, already stripped of its frozen crystals.
All around are seen teams and horses drawing huge
loads of snow to the distant shores, plows and markers, crossing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
and recrossing the cleared surface, and long lines of ice
blocks, which are being floated along the channels to the
incline, where the puffing engine imparts motion to swiftly
gliding, endless chains, which catch up the waiting cakes and
whisk them away up the incline and into the ice house, looking
as though they were endowed with life-motion and were
traveling of their own volition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ice Privileges and Legal Points—Artificial Ice Ponds and Sanitary
Care of Ice Ponds and Fields.</p>
</div>

<p>Attention is now being given to the sanitary condition of
the sources from whence supplies of natural ice are obtained.
Ice sold for domestic uses and cut from canal water, must, in
New York, be so labeled.</p>

<p>Agitation in this direction has led to the prohibition of ice
cutting on specified polluted waters, by some boards of health,
for any other than cooling purposes. In several States the ice
crop is protected by the enactment of laws which make it a
misdemeanor to destroy or injure ice in the field where it is to
be cut.</p>

<p>No doubt the preservation of the purity of our streams
and lakes will receive more care in the future, as sanitary
knowledge becomes more widely diffused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lakes Fed by Springs</span>, and having clean beds, have naturally
risen in value for ice cutting purposes. Running
streams, especially those with a rapid current, purify their
waters very rapidly. Exposure to light and air, the influence
of oxygen, and the motion of the water, all assist in this good
office. Foreign substances are expelled from the ice in the
process of freezing, and streams of this character, not polluted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
by the presence of sewerage, waste products from factories,
packing houses, gas works, etc., produce ice of great purity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ownership of Ice Fields</span> has been a bone of contention
in many instances, where a knowledge of the legal rights
involved would have saved expensive litigation. In a general
way, ice cutting rights are divided into two classes. Ice on
navigable waters is under the authority of the national government.
“Navigable,” in this instance, being used to denote
tide water, the proprietary rights of owners of the abutting
property are limited to the water line at high tides. On all
such waters, navigation being closed, the ice is free and is
secured by pre-emption, the first one to stake out claims being
entitled to cut the ice. In contentions over boundaries of ice
fields, where the issue is in doubt, the ice dealer whose property
forms the water front is given the preference.</p>

<p>Rivers, small lakes and navigable streams above tide water
are termed public. The boundary line of abutting property is
held to extend under the water to the center of the channel,
and includes the ownership of the ice formed above it. Public
convenience for navigation and commerce, however, take
precedence. The rights to this ice are thus subject to contract
and sale. The submerged land may also be sold, and all deeds
to water front property should clearly set forth the boundary
line and all the rights that are guarded and reserved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Where Dams are Built</span> across streams and the water
line is raised on property beyond the limits of that held by the
owner of the dam, consent must be obtained from the holders
of property thus affected.</p>

<p>There are numerous creeks and brooks which are fed by
springs, or have their source in spring lakes, which make
excellent ice fields, with very little labor or expense. Advantage
may be taken of low lands in the vicinity of such streams.
Gravel forms the best bed for ice ponds, as it is free from
weeds. In some of our lakes, occurring in districts abounding
in gravel, the water is pure and sweet and the gravelly bed
can be seen at great depths. Springs are usually numerous in
such localities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p>The following methods of preparing dams can be employed
in some situations. The depth of the pond and the force of
the current of the stream are to be taken into account in fixing
upon the proportions and construction of dams. Also the
quantity of water usually running into the pond and the
largest amount likely to be received during a season of flood.
If the soil is a light loam, or a seam of gravel is near the surface,
dig a trench down to a hard bottom, and on the pond
side drive in a row of stout boards, breaking joints and sloping
them toward the dam. Behind this paling fill in with clay
rammed down. A crib formed of logs notched and bolted
together, and lined or faced with plank on pond side, should
be set at the rear of the sub-paling. This crib is filled with
stones and clay or sand. The front is banked up with earth
and covered with rip-rap.</p>

<p>The center of the dam is provided with a sluiceway large
enough to carry off flood waters, and, at the bottom, a pipe or a
box well bedded in cement gives a current on the bottom
which carries off sediment. It is also useful in taking off air
and gases, which, arising from the bottom, form air bubbles in
the ice. Some water should always pass over the upper
sluiceway.</p>

<p>Dams may be formed entirely of an embankment of earth
and stone. Their base should not be less than their height,
with increased thickness where pressure from a current has to
be resisted. Shallow dams may be formed by driving two
rows of plank across the line of the dam, and filling in the
inclosed space with rammed clay. Break joints in the planking,
and bolt stringers along the top edges to bind them firmly
together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Changing the Course of Streams</span>, cut the new channel
deeper than the old one, to insure the current following it.
Straightening or changing the course of a stream will often
improve the topography of a farm and drain wet or marsh land.</p>

<p>Food fish, which can readily be raised in these ponds, forms
a welcome addition to the family larder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Purity of Brooks</span> which feed ice and fish ponds
should be preserved. No filth should be dumped into them or
on their banks. Stables and cesspools should not be situated
where they will drain into them. Vegetable refuse and litter,
which may be brought down with the current, should be
caught by screens and removed from time to time, or they
will accumulate in the pond and injure it.</p>

of Ice—Care of Ice Tools—Filling the Ice House—Closing

Field.</p>
</div>

<p>With the advent of a sharp freeze, attention is directed to
the ice field, from which a harvest is hoped for at no distant
day. The purification of the water has been given attention
before this time, together with all preliminaries relating to the
plant in its various and complex features. The weather now
determines the lot of the ice dealer. As the cold breezes
whistle over the water, stirring it into ripples, and breaking its
surface into waves, a wonderful change is rapidly transforming
its liquid pearls into flinty diamonds. Gradually the heat
in the water is radiated into the air. As fast as the surface
water is cooled, it is condensed, and sinks to the bottom, its
place being taken by the warmer and lighter water from
beneath. Gradually the entire mass reaches the point of maximum
density, at 39½° F. Below this temperature, until it
reaches 31° F., water expands as it is cooled. Now the surface
water no longer sinks as it grows colder, being rendered lighter
by expansion than the water beneath. Upon reaching 32°,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
convection, or freezing, takes place, and the surface assumes
the solid form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Care of the Ice Field.</span>—From this time until the crop is
stored in the ice house, the ice dealer devotes his energies to
the care of the ice field. Special situations develop special
duties and requirements, which the alert dealer studies with
care. If the ice is on a running stream, the possible pollution
of its higher levels will be carefully guarded against, and also
all rubbish removed from the surface of the field. Sticks and
stones bedded in the ice hinder the work and damage the keen
edges of the cutting tools. Motion in the water is necessary to
promote the growth of the ice, and, when the ice is sufficiently
heavy, traveling over the surface, or other jarring, is beneficial.
It has been found that where a roadway has been opened
across an ice field, and the travel over it considerable, the ice
was thicker along the roadway than at other places on the field.</p>

<p>On inclosed lakes or mill ponds, a gentle current induced
in the water promotes the growth of the ice materially. The
air is expelled from the water during freezing, if opportunity
is found for it to do so. Unless this is done, the ice is cloudy.
Agitation of the water assists the escape of the air; hence it is
that ice from running streams is usually clearer and more
brilliant than pond or lake ice. An outlet afforded to the land-locked
ponds and lakes is often beneficial during ice-making
weather. Too rapid a current, however, will retard growth,
and a gentle motion diffused over the entire field produces the
best results.</p>

<p>The growth should be carefully noted under different conditions,
attention being given to the atmospheric influences
and other general effects, and the regulation of the motion,
based on ascertained results at the locality where applied. As
the ice thickens, its growth is slower at the same, or even a
lower, temperature than that which at first made ice very
rapidly. The earth at the bottom and sides of the ice field
radiate heat into the water. The heat rays of the sun pass
through the ice, if it is clear, into the water below, with very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
little effect upon the ice itself. The ice, being a poor conductor
of heat, is, under these conditions, an obstacle to its own
growth. It shuts in the water from contact with the cooler
air, prevents agitation of its surface by passing breezes, and
retards the escape of air and heat.</p>

<p>On running streams, these conditions are much modified.
In passing over shallows or rapids, where the current is swift,
the water remains open and exposed to the air. At these
points in its course it parts with its accumulated air and heat
very rapidly, a thin vapor or mist being often perceptible in
the air at such places, owing to the rapid radiation. The tumbling
and turning of the water at rapid shoals materially assists
the growth of ice at points below where the current grows
gentle. Streams of this character, whose beds are free from
accumulations of vegetable mold, or other sources which generate
gases, produce clear and sparkling ice of greater thickness
than is found on still ponds or lakes in the same vicinity,
and exposed to the same temperature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Usefulness of Snow.</span>—Snow, as it is well known, is
a great impediment to the inroads of frost into anything enveloped
by it. A covering of snow on an ice field is a great
impediment to the escape of heat from the water, as well as
protecting the ice from the direct action of the cold air, and
greatly retards the growth of the ice. It is essential to remove
this snow as early as practicable, as the ice harvester has always
in view a possible thaw or rain, and endeavors to secure his
crop at the earliest practicable moment.</p>

<p>Snow, however, in the event of soft or warm weather, is
an aid to the ice by protecting it from the direct heat of the
sun, and the force of a rain is largely expended in melting the
snow. The water and snow on the top of the ice freezes into
snow ice as soon as the weather turns cold again. This snow
ice is white, being very porous and filled with air, and detracts
from the quality of the crop, its thickness depending on the
depth of snow on the field, amount of water, and the temperature.
At the top of this snow ice, where it merges into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
snow, will be found a stiff, crusty layer, more or less firmly
united to the ice below, which adds to the difficulty of removing
the snow on top. An inch or two of snow ice will lessen
the loss by breakage of cakes, in stowing, and the ice also
comes out of the house in better shape, and will stand shipping
better. It is not so brittle as clear ice, and is homogeneous in
its structure, not being readily split in any direction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Removal of Snow.</span>—Various methods and appliances are
in use for the expeditious and economical removal of snow.
As soon as the field will bear the weight of a horse, scrapers of
various designs are placed at work. If the ice is too thin to
support a horse safely, flooding is resorted to. At intervals of
six feet, more or less, according to the freedom with which
the water rises through the openings, holes are cut through
the ice, and the water saturates the lower part of the snow.</p>

<div id="il_1" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_017.jpg" width="1695" height="941" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 1. CLEARING OFF SCRAPER.</div></div>

<p>This helps to thicken the ice rapidly, and, if the weather is
cold, it will very soon be heavy enough to support a horse. As
soon as this is the case, the scrapers are placed at work. The
snow ice thus formed is afterward gotten rid of by planing, if
more than an inch or two in thickness. If the snow is light,
and not too deep, it is scraped into windrows, by scrapers
similar to those in Figs. <a href="#il_2">2</a>, <a href="#il_3">3</a> and <a href="#il_4">4</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>SNOW SCOOP SCRAPERS.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>These windrows are distributed over the field, not being
made large enough to sink the ice at any point. Scoop scrapers
are now employed, which gather up the windrows and carry
the snow off to the shore, or to a distance from where the ice
is to be cut. If the field is very large, and the snow deep,
dumping points are selected on the field. The weight of the
snow will sink the ice at these points, and cracks will soon
loosen the dump from the main body of ice. A deep groove
plowed alongside of the dump will assist in loosening the dump,
and keeps the water off the field. Some of these scoop scrapers
are constructed with great care, and nicely adapted to the
needs of the ice harvester.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Sudden Thaw</span> during the winter, while the ice crop is
forming, is an annoyance to the ice dealer, and, if accompanied
by rain, the field will often suffer by being flooded with
water from the surrounding hills. Sand and earth may be
washed on to the ice, making it dirty and injuring its quality.
Water standing on top of the field will soon comb and rot the
ice. If only an inch or two of water is on the field and the
weather turns cold, it can be left to freeze and then be
planed off.</p>

<p>If it is deep it can be readily handled, by cutting holes
through the ice, or tapping the ice field in a number of places;
the water, being heavier than the ice, will sink and raise the
ice, if it has opportunity of so doing. Tapping should have
prompt attention, and the water removed without delay.
Even if the water freezes on top, the ice is not of good quality
and is not part of the ice below. It forms a layer which is
attached to the old ice, but yet is not solidly a part of it, and
gives trouble by splitting out in barring off. Ice expels the
air while freezing principally toward the bottom, and as it has
no chance for escape through the ice beneath, the top layer
will show a white streak.</p>

<p>For tapping the field the auger and the tapping axe are
used. If the water is accumulating rapidly and despatch is
wanted, the axe will be found the more rapid-working tool.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
The auger, however, makes neater work, and leaves the field
in better shape—often an important desideratum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Outfit for Harvesting.</span>—Time is of great value in
handling ice in any of the various operations gone through
with on the field or in the house. Delays during harvesting
greatly increase the cost of getting ice prepared for the market.
Great care and much study have been devoted to perfecting
the paraphernalia by which the ice crop is handled, as
will appear as the reader follows the round of duties of the ice
harvester. In some emergencies the crop is only saved from
partial or complete loss by the despatch which modern development
of tools and machinery has placed at the command of
the enterprising ice dealer. The advent of warm weather during
the harvest demands the utmost celerity in all departments,
if the crop is secured.</p>

<p>More credit than is generally supposed to be warranted is
due to the splendid energy and managerial ability of the ice
harvester, during seasons when the home ice crop is a partial
or entire failure. No one, not practically familiar with the
business, can readily understand the extra strain and burden
imposed on the ice dealer who succeeds in securing supplies
sufficient to meet the requirements of his customers, by going
to the far north for this most beneficent and useful product of
nature. Enterprise pays in this, as in any business.</p>

<p>Having removed the snow the field is carefully inspected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
and quality and thickness of the ice ascertained in all parts.
The field is bored with the ice auger, and the measure indicates
the thickness. The auger is withdrawn and the appearance of
the ice noted before the auger reaches the bottom and water
fills the hole. If the snow ice is too heavy it must be removed.</p>

<div id="il_8" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 14em;">
  <img src="images/i_021.png" width="884" height="506" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 8. FIELD PLANER.</div></div>

<p>Two methods for doing this are available. It can be cut
loose and broken into chips with the snow ice planer on the
field, the chips being afterwards
cleared with scrapers
and scoops; or it can be left
on the ice and cut away by
the elevator ice planer as the
ice cakes pass up the endless
chain ice elevator incline, on
their way into the ice house.
The first method is in use wherever the endless chain ice
elevator is not employed. When it is to be removed by the
field planer, the ice field is first laid out and plowed to the
depth of the snow or sap ice to be removed. The snow ice
planer follows the plowed grooves, cutting off the refuse ice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thickness of Ice.</span>—Generally speaking, the ice is desired
at an average thickness of fourteen inches; this being convenient
for subsequent handling. In practice, the thickness of
the ice, as it is stored or shipped from the water, varies with
the exigencies of the season and the average thickness formed
at the locality.</p>

<p>In the latitude of Central and Southern Ohio six-inch ice
is often stored; in the vicinity of Chicago and Omaha, ten
inch; in Maine, sixteen inch, and in Minnesota, twenty inch.
Ice, thirty inches thick, has been cut and stored on Lake Superior,
in Northern Wisconsin, where ice forms equal in purity
and brilliancy to any found in this country. The ordinary
printing on the pages of a Chicago newspaper has been easily
read through a block of Lake Superior ice twenty-nine inches
thick. At Winnipeg, Manitoba, ice is cut forty inches in
thickness. Such thick ice keeps the year through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laying Out the Ice Field.</span>—As the ice field is inspected
and mapped out for plowing, all unsound places, air holes, or
shallow places where rocks or sand bars approach near to the
surface, are marked for avoidance. A convenient method is
to bore holes at such places, and plant pieces of brush in them.
Thin ice, formed where the ice has been removed during cutting,
is also marked in this manner, to give warning of the
danger of venturing upon it.</p>

<p>Like a good general, the ice harvester takes note of the
physical advantages of his position. If he can so lay out the
field that the current and prevailing winds are in his favor
and assist to float the ice toward the house, his strategy is not
without reward. Room for refuse ice is needed where it will
not impede the ice floating toward the house. The lay of the
shore line must not be overlooked, on streams where the current
is strong, in calculating for support for the shore ice.
The best ice in the field will always be secured as a prime
consideration.</p>

<p>Quality should always be of the first importance, and, in
these days of close competition, pure ice is necessary for success
in the ice business. Ice, for any purpose, should never be
cut from impure or contaminated water. Too much care can
not be given to securing clean, pure, healthful ice for all uses,
directly or remotely allied to preserving or curing food products.
Natural ice from pure crystal water is one of nature’s
purest productions.</p>

<p>Having gone over the field and determined the plan of
operation, the first task is to lay out the base lines from which
the marking and plowing are gauged. Stakes are planted at
either end of the line, and a heavy cord drawn taut between
them. The hand plow is now passed alongside the line, making
a score in the ice from end to end. Sometimes a long
board with sights is used for laying out the first line, and a
line marker is a cheap substitute for the hand plow. The
teeth of the horse marker are now set in the hand plow groove;
the guide is unlatched and runs along on top of the ice. Care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
is taken to keep the marker upright, by firmly supporting the
handles. This cuts a groove three inches deep. The blade of
the guide is now placed in this groove, and the marker cuts a
new groove parallel with the first one.</p>

  <div class="caption">FIG. 14. LINE MARKER.</div></div>

<p>This operation is continued until the field is grooved in
parallel lines over its surface in one direction. Plows are now
started in the marker grooves, and are run back and forth
until the grooves have been cut about two-thirds through the
ice, care being taken to leave not less than four inches of solid
ice below the bottom of the groove.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the marker is at work scoring the field in lines
at right angles to those first laid out. A large wooden square
with legs about fifteen feet long is used to square from, and
the field is marked and plowed in both directions.</p>

<p>When the snow ice plane is to be used, the field is marked
out in one direction only. The depth cut is regulated by a
planer gauge, attached to the marker, to the thickness of the
snow ice to be removed. The runners of the plane set in the
grooves and are guided by them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Channels and Canals.</span>—The marking and plowing being
well under way, the channels and canals require attention.
Where the current is gentle, and on ponds and lakes, the opening
of the channel and canals is not attended with much difficulty.
Where the current is swift, as on the large rivers,
practical skill is required in opening up the field. The pressure
of the current makes it difficult to open the channel and
canals, and the shore ice is in danger of giving way. Stays
and braces are sometimes employed to anchor the shore ice,
and to prevent the channels from closing.</p>

<p>In some instances it has been found advisable to have the
channel permanently fixed by piles driven into the bottom of
the river on either side. In others, braces are set in the ice,
at short intervals, before the channel is opened, as shown
in the illustration. The posts should be heavy, and the
cross struts may be ten or twelve inches square. The post
holes, if cut oblong, will allow short boards to be spiked to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
sides of the posts at their lower ends. When inserted through
the ice, a quarter turn of the post will bring the projecting
ears under the ice, and no trouble will be given by the post
raising out of its place. The cross strut should just allow the
ice to float beneath, and be well secured to the posts, which
require inclined braces, joining the posts opposite the ends of
the struts, with their feet planted in recesses cut into the ice.
Water should be poured around the braces, and when the
braces and posts are frozen in place a very strong support is
secured against the current, as the following cut shows.</p>

<div id="il_15" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_026.png" width="1702" height="705" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 15. BRACES FOR CHANNEL WITH SWIFT CURRENT.</div></div>

<p>Where the current is not so strong, square frames may be
employed. They are placed in the channel where the ice
cake will float through freely; their sides should fill mortices
in the sides of the channel, and not project into the path of
the cakes, as shown in <a href="#il_16">Fig. 16</a>.</p>

<p>Various methods of dealing with cracks in the ice have
been tried. A good one is to take long planks and extend
them across the cracks laying flat on the surface. By boring
through the planks into the ice, and inserting wooden pins,
the loosened portion is firmly held, and the cracks will freeze
up. If the pins are inclined in opposite directions a firm hold
is secured on the ice.</p>

<p>When the channel has been located, if convenient, a deep
groove is plowed at either side, and the remaining ice is cut
away with the pond ice saws. Splitting chisels are now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
brought into play, and the ice in the channel is split up into
cakes, which are sunk and floated under the ice. Canals
through the plowed field are similarly opened. The field is
now in readiness to furnish a supply of ice cakes for stowing
in the house.</p>

<div id="il_16" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_027.png" width="1686" height="788" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 16. BRACE FOR SLOW CURRENT.</div></div>

<p>A section is selected, and the grooves carefully double
calked with chips, from the plowing, to prevent the water running
in. For this purpose a calking bar is used. Ice saws are
now brought into requisition, and the grooves at the ends of
the section are sawed through to the back. The groove at the
back is now struck into at several points with one or another
of the barring off tools provided for this work. A section
called a float, and containing one hundred to one thousand or
more cakes, is readily split off. The tools used for this work
vary with the thickness of the ice and the size of the floats.
The fork bars are the most often used, the two-prong bar being
the favorite on heavy ice. If the first cuts with the saws are
so made that the ice cut away is a little wider on the bottom
than on the top, and the sides parallel, it will facilitate getting
out the first float cut away. By sinking the float a little all
pinching or binding at the sides is prevented.</p>

<p>The floats are split into rows of single or double cakes, as
they are floated near to the channel leading to the incline. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
the long rows are moved into the channel, a man, standing on
a bridge a few inches above the ice, strikes a needle or splitting
chisel into the plowed grooves as they are passed beneath
his feet. One or two dexterous thrusts will cleave the ice to
the bottom. In frosty weather, with the ice hard, it can be
split true and square, in most instances. Cakes not smoothly
split must be trimmed before they reach the incline, and the
bunches removed.</p>

<p>The work on the field is directed to secure a supply of ice
cakes at the foot of the incline, in advance of the requirements
of those whose duty is found in placing the cakes in position
within the ice house. No more than will be run into the house,
and also leave the channel full, with some floats near at hand
at quitting time, should be detached from the field.</p>

<p>Ice floats left too long before being broken up into single
cakes, are in danger of having the grooves flooded, and wholly
or partially frozen up. In this condition they are either worthless
or split up with much labor and great irregularity. The
single cakes left in the channel over night serve to prevent it
being closed with ice in the morning, and the delay incident
to opening it up is avoided.</p>

<p>Some early work, however, is always needed on the channels.
The single cakes will have a connecting web of new ice,
which must be broken up and trimmed from the sides of the
channel and the cakes. The broken ice and damaged cakes
which are not wanted must be kept clear of the channel at all
times. The larger pieces may be sunk under the ice, and the
smaller ones be removed by the scoop nets or sieve shovels. A
snowstorm during the harvest is attended with much discomfort
to the ice harvesters. The channels are filled with slush,
which packs around the floats and cakes, making their progress
slow and laborious. It eludes the scoop net and is very
hard to deal with. The field is soon buried out of sight, and
must be cleared and scraped with as little delay as practicable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Housing the Ice.</span>—There is room for large latitude for
variations in the methods employed on the ice field. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
situations are so different that the dealer is called upon to exercise
judgment and ingenuity, in determining what is best to be
done. On swift running streams the ice, after first forming,
may be broken by storms, and with a return of settled weather,
will freeze in rough and confused masses of broken ice in
places. At other points no floating ice has found lodgment,
and the second freezing is regular and of good quality. In
order to secure the ice from these favored spots, the harvester
may be obliged to open a channel several miles in length, and
float the ice down to where his storage houses are located.</p>

<p>At the foot of the incline at which the ice cakes are taken
from the water, and along the channel directly leading to it,
the ice is subject to much wear. The work necessarily done
on the cakes as they are floated through this channel, requires
the presence of a number of trimmers and bar men at this
point, as well as those who are feeding the cakes into the elevator,
or placing them in position for the grapple. The tools
used at the foot of the incline and near by channel are illustrated
on Pages 00–00.</p>

<p>There is often an accumulation of refuse ice taken from
the channel and thrown on the ice not far away. Ice cakes
sometimes slip from the grapples on their way up the incline,
and slide down, striking with great force at the foot of the
incline. All these, and other sources of wear, on the ice, make
it important to provide some protection to the sides of the
channel, and, as the edges soon dip below the surface of the
water, a footing or walk for the channel men. Where elevating
by means of grapples, it will be found a convenience, and
often the means of avoiding delays, to have a water box or
trough sunk in the channel, at a depth to admit the cakes
passing freely on to the lower end, and yet near enough the
surface to prevent the cakes ducking, or dodging under, when
pressed forward from the rear. The jackman, as the slack is
taken out of the line and the pull is felt, bears a firm grip on
the handle of his grapple, and, at the same time, bears down
heavily, and ducks the heel of the cake, engaged by the grapple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
under the water. The men who are placing the cakes for the
jacks, if the ice is heavy, bear down on the cake with their
pike poles at the same time, to prevent the last cake from
being ended over. The water box is necessary, at these times,
to steady the cake below, and prevent it sinking too deep.
Several cakes are usually run up at one trip. A sharp lookout
is necessary on the part of the jackman, and some experience
is required to become an adept at handling the grapple. Serious
accidents have resulted from careless or ignorant methods,
and caution should be observed by all who are employed about
the field, incline, or ice house. The construction of the water
box varies with the depth of water and amount of ice run
over it. Usually it is of a temporary character, and renewed
each year. Order and a thorough system should be carefully
adapted to the work on the field and in the house, by
every ice harvester. Details, fully worked out, and the plan
once in force, it should be strictly observed by the proprietor,
and exact compliance insisted upon from all employes. Unless
discipline is maintained, especially on large fields, much loss
of time and money will result, and life and limb be jeopardized.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Care of Ice Tools.</span>—Provision for preserving the cutting
qualities of tools is of great importance. An inferior tool, or
one out of repair, will detract from the efficiency of the labor
employed to use it. The amount depends on the particular
kind of work under consideration, and the comparative condition
of the tool with which it is done. Attention to this matter
is often neglected, from a failure to properly estimate its
importance, or from a mistaken idea of the ease with which
an incompetent or ignorant man can spoil the best implement
which can be made. Ice saws, of the best type, will, when
new, cut rapidly and true; one or two dressings, done in the
wrong way, will detract from their cutting efficiency one-fourth
or more, and it will be impossible to cut true with them.</p>

<p>One man should be trained to correctly dress the saws, and
then be held responsible for their work. When the teeth are
worn short, or the saws are sprung, send them to the ice tool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
manufacturer, to have the teeth gummed out to their correct
size and shape, and the blades straightened and stiffened. Ice
plows are frequently rendered useless by improper dressing or
careless handling. The range and proportion of the teeth, as
they are when new, must be kept up, and the cutting points
sharp and keen. The heels and bottoms must be dressed down
regularly with the points,—no more, no less. Only a man of
known ability should be allowed, under any pretext, to dress
the ice plows.</p>

<p>Any delay in plowing may involve the loss of part of the
crop, and any detention of the work of those detaching the
cakes from the field, from a lack of plowed surface to work
upon, may prove to be the cause of an hour or more time lost
or frittered away by nine-tenths of the entire force employed,
both on the field and in the house. Nine-tenths of the entire
wages, for an hour or more, is thus lost to the owner, and an
incompetent workman is the apparent cause. The lack of management
and system is, more likely, the source of this waste.</p>

<p>Plows which have been worn so they cut hard, need gumming
out, or reforging, or both. Plows and markers are the
chief cutting implements of the ice harvester. Too much care
cannot be taken to make a proper selection, originally. The
best plows are now made with steel beams and steel bolts.
They are superior to the old style iron plows. The guides used
on plows and markers should have no lost motion, at any
point, when the guide handle is latched in place. The latest
improvements are in the trussed form of guide, which is perfectly
rigid, and the double hinge and swivel method of securing
the handle to the guide, combined with the pin and mortice
latch. This construction produces a plow and guide which has
no looseness in any joint, and is so braced that the plow cannot
depart from a vertical position unless the guide is raised out of
its groove.</p>

<p>All ice cutters who have had their fields marked in curved,
instead of straight, lines, with the resulting wrenching or
breaking of plow teeth, will appreciate and welcome this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
improvement. Bars, tongs, and hooks should be kept sharp,
and, when out of repair, sent to the maker, to be brought back
to a condition of efficiency. The close of the cutting season is
the best time to select and ship to the ice-tool maker all
implements which require overhauling.</p>

<p>A tool room should be provided, of sufficient size to store
all cutting tools, scoops, scrapers, and extras of all kinds that
are liable to breakage or rapid wear. Space should be reserved
for a filing bench, having a large north light, and a grindstone—driven
by power when practicable—for sharpening bars,
hooks, and tongs. Where the ice houses are large, and in
isolated positions, the tool house, if well fitted up, is of great
assistance, affording the means for making repairs of an
urgent character. A good set of millwright tools, together
with a well-chosen supply of seasoned timber, of such sizes as
are used in the various runs and connections, will often repay
their cost in a single season. Large boarding houses are often
found included in the ice harvester’s inventory. This is a
necessity where the storage houses are situated any distance
from towns or cities. Several hundred men are sometimes
thus accommodated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Filling the House.</span>—Ice should be housed during freezing
weather, if possible, as the cakes will then enter the ice house
dry and hard. In soft weather the ice is soft, and contains
some water; the cakes, being chilled in the house, are frozen
together, causing an increase of labor and breakage in getting
the ice out for shipment during the summer. When the ice is
heavy, of best quality, and stowed, during freezing weather,
in a well-constructed ice house, it can be kept for two or three
seasons, and then be taken out in good condition, with but
little extra loss by breakage. It should have attention at all
times, however, and be kept in perfect order.</p>

<p>The various methods which are in use for elevating the ice
cake from the water into the ice house, or on to the platform,
will be noticed in detail, under a special chapter devoted to this
important branch of the mechanics of the natural ice trade.</p>

<p>The ice cake, as it enters the ice house, does so on a skid, or
run, which is placed at an inclination, the end nearest the
entrance higher than the end leading in toward the center of
the room. At its lower end the skid is connected with another
having the same general inclination, and thus a continuous
line of runs is formed, extending from the entrance to the farther
part of the room. The inclination of these runs is determined
by the distance the ice is to travel on them, and the
height of the galleries on the front of the ice house.</p>

<p>The runs are usually arranged with a rapid descent near
the entrance, and the further end, on a level with the intermediate
portion, graduated between these extremes. When the
inclination imparts too high a speed to the cakes, a break is set
into the runs. It usually consists of a board, in which a number
of large nails are driven, with their heads left projecting
above the surface. This board is set in the line of the runs, or
attached to one of them, so the under surface of the ice
scratches on the nail heads. The number of nails and the
depth of the scratches is easily varied to suit the velocity
required.</p>

<p>As the ice cakes are run into the ice house, they are stored
at the farther end first, and are gradually filled in toward the
front. Through the back and center of the room, stowing is
most rapidly performed. Filling the front end, and under the
runs, require more time and care. The ice cakes are moved
into place with ice hooks and tongs. As the cakes pass along
the runs, they are caught with the ice hook and guided off the
run, at either side, as desired. The runs are made flat, with
no projecting sides or rails. Two lines of the V-shaped run
iron are placed on the runs, and the ice will follow them, but
is readily slipped off when wanted. The accompanying cuts
show the common patterns of runs, and the tools used in the
house during packing.</p>

<p>The hooks, tongs, and runs are used in directing the cakes
to their final positions. The bars, chisels, and adze are used to
trim any inequalities off from the cakes, and, in some cases, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
level off each layer of ice as it is stored. This is not so often
done, when ice is stored for shipment from the house, as in
cooling rooms, when it is desired to pack as much ice as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Packing Ice in the House.</span>—The method employed in
arranging the ice cakes varies in different parts of the country.
The important thing to keep in mind is the amount of good,
merchantable ice possible to be gotten out of the house, as it is
shipped away during the warm season. This does not depend
upon how much can be crowded in, but upon the packing and
arranging of the cakes. Two things are to be observed in this,
prevention of waste by melting, and ease in loosening or
detaching the cakes, as they are taken out. The following
method may be taken as an example, and varied as good cause
is found for so doing.</p>

<p>If the ice is thin, place the two first courses on edge, and
pack as closely together as practicable. The succeeding courses
place in flat, or in the same position they occupy on the water.
Arrange the cakes one directly above the other, and leave a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
space of two inches on all four sides or edges. In every five or
six courses, joints are broken. The last four or five courses on
top are placed, each one, to break joints, and closely placed at
edges. The reasons for this arrangement are, that the ice on
the floor of the house wastes rapidly, and, by placing the cakes
on edge, the minimum loss is obtained, and the succeeding
cakes, placed one above the other, and free on the edges, having
only the top and bottom surfaces in contact, the minimum
breakage and labor, in loosening cakes, is obtained; also, by
breaking the joints every few courses, the circulation of air
currents, which is very destructive to the ice, is shut off, and,
finally, the top courses close in the mass thoroughly, and
prevent the top covering from sifting down into the body of
the ice.</p>

<p>The chapters on loss of ice by wastage in the house, and
the construction of ice houses, will present more fully some of
the considerations bearing upon the methods of stowing the ice.</p>

<p>In some localities the ice cakes are all placed upon edge.
Among the advantages claimed for this method are, ease in
loosening and taking out the cakes, and the closer packing
secures more ice, where storage room is limited. There is a
risk of damage to the ice house, by the pressure of the ice
against the side walls, when packed in this manner. The
edges, being uneven, tend to throw the ice out of plumb, or to
give the whole mass an inclination in one direction. In stowing,
care is required to keep the spaces between the cakes free
from chips or broken ice.</p>

<p>No more trimming than is necessary should be done in the
house, and the crowding of cakes together on the runs, and in
sliding them to their places, should be avoided. Broken cakes
should not be allowed to come into the house, and, if cakes are
broken in placing, they should be thrown out of the house.</p>

<p>Experience and practice, in the handling of runs and managing
the progress of the stowing of the ice cakes, attest the
value of system in this department. To do the necessary work
with as much despatch as possible requires close attention to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
details, and watchfulness, that the labor and efforts of the men
are properly directed and distributed.</p>

<p>The runs outside the house are permanent, and arranged in
galleries, about five feet apart, with connecting runs from each
gallery to the incline. The top run is placed well up to the
plate. At each intersection of the incline and runs to the galleries,
there is a gate, which may be removed from the face of
the incline, thus affording access from the incline to the runs.
The gate at the lower run being open, the ice cakes all pass on
to the first run, and enter the house at this height. When the
house has been filled with ice to the height of the first run, or
one or two courses higher, the level of the house is then too
high to handle the ice over the lower run. The incline gate
is now placed in position, shutting off the first run, and the
ice is raised upon the incline to the height of the second run,
and passes into the house at this level.</p>

<p>It is now necessary to rearrange the runs within the ice
house. They must be uncoupled from the first gallery, and
raised up and secured at the height of the second gallery. The
under blocking and bracing is removed, and the runs set to
one side. Before they are disturbed, a number of ice cakes
are run in, and left near the entrance, to be stowed in the
space the runs and staging occupied, directly in front of the
entrance. Unless care is taken, this filling in will be done with
irregularity, and more or less broken ice will be left among the
good cakes, causing loss by wastage and breakage, when the
house is opened up. This filling in under the runs suspends
the ordinary work of stowing, and is attended with some loss
of time.</p>

<p>After the cakes are all in place, the house runs are raised
up, blocked and braced in position, the connecting runs
coupled on, and a new line of runs conducts the ice from the
second gallery to the further part of the room.</p>

<p>A system of winding drums, placed in the roof timbers,
with ropes attached to the runs, at either end, saves time and
labor, in adjusting the house runs to the levels of the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
galleries; also, in shifting them, as they are raised to the level
of the courses, as the cakes are placed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Closing and Caring for the House.</span>—When the room has
been filled to the level of the wall plate, the ice is covered with
dry planing-mill shavings or sawdust, ten or twelve inches
deep. The entrance opening is closed, and filled in with sawdust,
or other packing.</p>

<p>The harvest being secured, the ice house carefully closed,
and all chance for circulation prevented by a top dressing, it
requires regular attendance once a day, to trim the top covering,
if any part of it should sink into the crevices between
the ice cakes.</p>

<p>As the warmer days and spring rains set in, the proper
ventilation of the ice house is important. All steam or vapor
arising from the ice should be gotten rid of as soon as possible.
The various plans which are in use to attain this end, will be
found in the chapter on wastage and care of ice in the house.</p>

<p>As soon as the tools for harvesting are no longer required
for use, they should be promptly gathered together, and
inspected. All that have been broken, or damaged, should be
bundled up and consigned to the manufacturer, to be put in
thorough cutting order, and returned to the ice house, in the
early fall. All other tools should be carefully cleaned, and all
bright or polished steel coated with oil, to preserve from rust,
cases strapped to plows and saws, and all neatly packed away
in tool house, which should be dry. Snow scoops and scrapers
are better for an occasional coat of paint, and, if stored in a
dry, cool place, sheltered from the weather, will last much
longer. It is a good plan to have all the tools inventoried
directly after the cutting season, and they should be marked
with the owner’s name or initials.</p>

<p>The elevator machinery should also be inspected, and any
defects noted, for early repair, the apron raised from the
water, and the water shaft and fittings cleaned, and thoroughly
oiled. The ice chain, if given a coat of slushing oil,
will take no harm. All machinery which is exposed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
weather should be thoroughly coated with slushing oil. The
engine should have attention, and all working parts be preserved
from rust. All the brass trimmings on engines or boiler
should be taken down, boxed, and stored in a secure place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shipping Ice From the Field.</span>—While the ice house is
being filled, winter shipments of ice may be made to points
where supply stations are maintained distant from any cutting
privilege. Large shipments are often made to points south of
the frost line, or where the crop is deficient. To accommodate
this traffic, loading platforms are built with connecting runs
from the lower incline run. A switch is arranged by which
the ice cakes can be directed, either on to the loading platform
or into the ice house. Long trains of cars can be filled daily.
At a single platform, ten to fifteen cars are loaded at one time,
while a double platform will accommodate double the number.</p>

<p>If the side tracks are placed at both sides of the platform,
no time will be lost while cars are being switched, a train
loaded on one track being switched out, and the track filled
with empty cars, while loading proceeds in the cars on the
other track. Diagrams of these platforms are shown at <a href="#il_52">Fig. 52</a>.
Endless chains, with bars at short spaces, pass along the
top of the platform, and carry a cake, at a regular speed,
before each bar. (See <a href="#il_51">Fig. 51</a>.) A short doorway slide is
placed between the car and platform, and a man, stationed at
the car door with an ice hook, slides the cakes into the car as
fast as the stowers can place them.</p>

<p>The earliest reference to the use of snow for cooling purposes
occurs in Holy Writ, and carries us back about three
thousand years. History records the custom which prevailed
among the Romans, of storing snow upon the mountains during
the winter, which was made use of in the summer for
cooling beverages. Vaults, or pits, of circular form at the top,
and tapering to a point at the bottom, were scooped out in the
ground. The sides were lined, and the top thickly thatched
with straw, after being filled with snow, which was tightly
packed. The doorway was through the top. A modernized
Roman snow cellar is shown in Figs. <a href="#il_44">44</a> and <a href="#il_45">45</a>, which is taken
from a cellar in use in Virginia. Its successor in the transition
to more modern designs is seen in Figs. <a href="#il_46">46</a> and <a href="#il_47">47</a>.</p>

<p>Before ice was cut and stored for commercial uses in this
country it was secured, in many instances, by those who used
it in their business. Brewers, dairymen, butchers, and some
physicians, had ice vaults, or cellars, constructed on the
Roman method. The first commercial ice houses were built
below the surface of the ground. Gradually they emerged
into the light and air, being only partly below the surface.
Brick, stone and wood were in use for building materials.
Gradually, experience leading the way, the ice dealer has
evolved the modern ice house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Modern Ice House</span> represents many years of development,
and has a scientific, as well as a practical, value.
Improvements may be expected in this as in other branches of
the ice business. The discoveries and inquiries which scientific
and practical men are continually making in this direction
are rapidly adding to our store of knowledge. Ice houses, as
now built and furnished, give few suggestions of their original
prototype.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Site.</span>—Many features are combined in a really good
site for a commercial or large ice house. Good ice in ample
quantity, a porous soil, easy accessibility both from the water
and land, proximity to market; also cheap and efficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
transportation. Observance of the first and last of these points is
imperative. Where natural drainage is lacking, the deficiency
can be supplied, and access effected, in most instances, if the
other features warrant the expense.</p>

<p>In selecting a site, when the lay of the land will permit,
place the length of the house north and south, and arrange the
incline and runs with as few turns as practicable. The ice
cakes require assistance to keep them in motion on a crooked
runway, and are constantly being jammed and spalled. On a
direct run of proper pitch the cakes will travel without attention
in freezing weather. On warm, sloppy days, when the
ice is soft, it will require assistance. The platforms for winter
shipments <i>via</i> rail come in for attention in placing the incline,
which should be conveniently disposed for supplying them
with ice cakes as fast as they can be handled. System and
dispatch are the watchwords of the ice dealer while ice
cutting is on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Survey and Foundation.</span>—The location and size of the
house being determined, a survey is made and all lines staked
out. It is important to have the foundations square and of
the exact size, so that dimension lumber and roof trusses will
fit as designed. Levels, also, call for attention, and the entire
site should be brought to grade.</p>

<p>In the construction of foundations practice varies. They
are partly dependent upon local conditions and climatic influences.
For large houses, where the wastage is readily drained
off and the sills are comparatively dry, they are about as durable
as the balance of the building when placed directly on
the ground.</p>

<p>The life of an ice house varies from so many causes, that
no limit can be given applicable to all cases. When the lumber
is well selected and the construction thorough, fifteen
years of constant service will tell plainly on the building. If
repairs are made as often as required, its term of usefulness
is extended.</p>

<p>In warm climates, also for smaller houses, and for city
supply depots, foundations of stone or brick are employed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
advantage. They should be put in below frost, and extend
about two feet above the surface.</p>

<div id="il_48" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38em;">
  <img src="images/i_046.png" width="2411" height="1729" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 48. PLATE <i class="large">A</i>. GROUND PLAN.</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Details of Construction.</span>—In the building illustrated in
plates <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, the sills are placed upon the ground. The house
is divided into four rooms, each forty feet wide in the clear,
two hundred and fifty feet deep, and forty feet high from sill
to plate. The dimensions of lumber required may be:</p>

<p>For outside sills, 8 × 10 inches, of such lengths as can most
readily be obtained.</p>

<p>Inside sills, 6 × 10.</p>

<p>Outside posts, 4 × 10 inches × 40 feet, set 12 feet apart.</p>

<p>Studding, 3 × 10 inches × 40 feet, with three feet centers.</p>

<p>Inside posts, 4 × 8 inches × 40 feet. Studding, 3 × 8 inches
× 40 feet.</p>

<p>For outer circulating air space, the studding should be
2 × 8 inches × 40 feet, with three feet centers.</p>

<p>For inner dead air spaces, 2 × 6 inches × 40 feet studding
are placed upright 12 feet apart, and horizontal cross studs
2 × 6 inches × 12 feet and three feet apart, are filled in between.
This makes spaces 3 × 12 feet on the inside of all the outer
walls.</p>

<p>Plates on the outer walls are 3 × 10, and on inner walls
3 × 8 inches.</p>

<p>The main studding is lined on both sides with moisture-proof
sheathing, and boarded up with matched lumber. The
inclosed space is filled with non-conducting substance, usually
sawdust or spent tan bark. The filling must be dry and
packed tightly.</p>

<p>The inner 2 × 6 studding is lined with sheathing, and then
boarded up with matched lumber. The joints of this studding
should be made with care and the lumber selected, no crooked
stock being used. Sealing up these joints with pitch adds to
their efficiency, and also to the durability of the lumber.</p>

<p>The outer studding is covered with weather boarding or
ship siding. Twelve inches at the bottom are left open and
hinged covers swung over them, which can be opened or closed
as ventilation requires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<div id="il_49" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 43em;">
  <img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="2749" height="1299" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 49. PLATE <i class="large">B</i>. CROSS SECTION.</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>The interior walls have 4 × 8 inch × 40 feet posts, and 3 × 8
studding, which are boarded on either side with matched lumber
and filled.</p>

<p>The lower section of these walls, to a height of ten to fifteen
feet, is often left without filling, as it is more exposed to
the ill effects of moisture, and requires renewal before the
upper portion. This is more conveniently done where no filling
is in the wall.</p>

<p>In the center of each room, on the end at which the ice
cakes enter, an opening is left extending from the sills to the
plate. As the house is filled with ice these openings are closed
up. Boards are provided, when building, which will fit into
place and make the walls at these openings, as near as practicable,
the same as in other places. The middle section being
filled and planked by the inner and outer air spaces.</p>

<p>At the opposite end of the rooms a similar opening is provided.
For closing it a slightly different plan is adopted. The
outer section is divided into doors five or six feet high, swung
on hinges; these take the place of the weather boarding. The
interior wall is then arranged the same as the one at the opposite
end of the room. These doors can be opened as the ice is
coming out, and remain closed at other times.</p>

<p>Interior partition walls are sometimes of value. It is
thought they add to the durability of the house, and also effect
a saving in wastage. In the majority of houses they are
dispensed with.</p>

<p>The construction of the roof will be found convenient and
substantial, if the plans shown in Plate <a href="#il_49"><i>B</i></a> are followed. Light-colored
roofing composition should be used, avoiding tar and
gravel, or tin, as these both attract and absorb the heat.
Gable roofs, with good shingles laid four or five inches to the
weather, are the best roofs for ice houses. They are cooler
and more durable than most composition coverings.</p>

<p>The posts in <a href="#il_49">Diagram <i>B</i></a> can be extended and additional
bracing put in. The increased area and weight will require a
proportional addition to the strength of roof timbers. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
sizes of timbers for ice house construction, noted in this chapter,
consideration has been given to durability, and while
lighter material is employed, in some instances, the houses are
sooner racked and sprung out of place.</p>

<div id="il_50" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 44em;">
  <img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="2767" height="1816" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 50. PLATE <i class="large">C</i>. SECTION OF ELEVATOR INCLINE AND PLATFORM CONVEYORS.</div></div>

<p>The ventilator on top is about twenty feet square and two
feet high, with slats on all sides. It will not be required on
high gable roofs, an opening in each gable end being sufficient
to carry off the moisture and heated air. The gable ends
should be well braced against the wind.</p>

<p>At the center of roof trusses a floor is laid through the
building, dividing the space above the ice. Trap doors are cut
through this floor about seventy-five feet apart, four to six
feet in size; these doors are for ventilating the space between
the ice and the floor, and for dumping the sawdust through on
top of the ice. It also affords a convenient place in which the
sawdust can be stored and dried, when the houses are cleaned
in the fall.</p>

<p>The outer circulating air-spaces are continued to the level
of the loft floor, discharging the air into the loft, where it
finds vent through the ventilator.</p>

<p>The eaves project about two feet, and are provided with
ample gutters, which are furnished with large conductor pipes
every fifty feet. On the side of the house where galleries are
placed, the roof is extended to cover them, or, if at a gable end,
a special roof is provided.</p>

<p>Lightning rods are especially required on ice houses.
Being often the most prominent object in their locality, the
electric fluid finds its readiest path through them, and the
escaping vapor and much of the material used in their construction
add to their exposure. Copper strips, terminating in
forked points, raised above the cone of the roof, fifty or
seventy-five feet apart each way, provide ample protection. A
line of points across the house should be connected, and the
copper strips extended, without any break or interruption,
into the ground. They should be buried several feet below
the surface, and if they terminate in a drain or other damp
place, their efficiency is increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>The floor of each room is graded slightly toward the center,
and a trench dug through the center from end to end. It
should have a grade toward the front of the house of about
two inches in a rod. At the rear of the house it may be nine
inches square, gradually increasing to double this size at the
front of the house. Lateral drains, alternating on either side,
are desirable. If the surface drainage sets toward the house,
it should be intercepted and conducted away. After the
trenches are made they are filled with broken stone or cobbles
about nine inches deep at the start, and double the depth at
the front of the house. The side trenches may be six or eight
inches wide, and filled about the same depth.</p>

<p>On top of the stones, shavings, straw, reeds, or other
porous filling, is placed, to the level of the floor. The entire
floor is now covered with a layer of charcoal, or with coal
ashes placed several inches deep. On top are laid boards, not
too closely placed, with length toward the main drain. The
spaces between the boards form channels to conduct the
waste water to the drains. Where the drains emerge from
the house they are trapped, to prevent any air currents from
entering through them, and collected into one or more main
channels.</p>

<p><a href="#il_48">Plate <i>A</i></a> illustrates the drainage plan, and a section view is
presented in <a href="#il_49">Plate <i>B</i></a>. In porous soils, which can be depended
on to carry off the wastage, drains are not so necessary. For
very large houses, however, they should not be entirely
neglected. In warm climates and for city supply houses,
cement floors are the best.</p>

<p>For loading cars for winter shipments, the platforms illustrated
in plates <i>A</i>, <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> are used for handling large quantities.
The ice cakes are elevated on the incline to runways
(see <i>R</i>, in Plates <i><a href="#il_48">A</a></i>, <i><a href="#il_50">C</a></i> and <i><a href="#il_52">D</a></i>), and slide by gravity until landing
on the platform. An endless chain with cross-bars passes
over the top of this platform, carrying a cake before each bar.
Where a railroad siding is placed on both sides of the platform
the work is expedited, as no delay is occasioned by waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
for cars, a loaded train being pulled out and empty cars run
in on one track, while loading continues on the other.</p>

<div id="il_53" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26em;">
  <img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="1651" height="2208" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 53. PLATE <i class="large">E</i>. HOISTING GIGS AND REVERSING ENGINE.</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Inclined Ways</span> shown in <a href="#il_50">Plate <i>C</i></a> are rigged with
endless chains, which carry cross-bars. In filling the house,
the ice cakes are floated to the foot of the incline, and fed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
to it, one or two cakes at a time in front of each bar, and thus
is made to travel up the incline. The cakes are passed through
gates on to the runways at the various levels desired, and pass
over these, by gravity, into the ice house.</p>

<p>There are two methods of arranging the chains—called
the over-shot and the under-shot. The first named is mostly
used, and is the one shown in <a href="#il_50">Plate <i>C</i></a>. The power required
varies with the length of the incline and with the style of the
elevators, which are arranged for one or two cakes on a bar.
The smaller rigs are operated with an eight or ten horse power
engine, and the larger plants up to one hundred horse power,
where several elevators and platform conveyors are coupled
on to one engine. For filling smaller houses there are several
methods in use, a choice depending on the surroundings and
size of the room or house.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the endless chain system, are the
jack grapples by which large quantities of ice are annually
stored. An incline is used which is similar to the one shown
on <a href="#il_50">Plate <i>C</i></a>, but of lighter build. These grapples are operated
with horses, or with steam power, when winding drums are
employed. By using friction-winding drums, the jack grapples
readily accomplish the work of a single elevator, and are
less expensive. This plan is shown in <a href="#il_53">Plate <i>E</i></a>. An ordinary
threshing engine furnishes ample power, and this method is
rapidly growing in favor. Where the ice house is placed at
the edge of the water and there is no room in which to place
an incline, the gigs are very convenient. When they are
operated by means of a winding drum run by a reversing
engine, and large enough to handle four cakes at a time, they
are very efficient. Economy of power, simplicity and ease of
management, are all in their favor.</p>

<p>Small houses and cooling rooms are filled with the aid of
hoisting tongs.</p>

<p>Care of Ice in the House—Leaking and Waste, How Prevented—Getting
out Ice—Lowering Machines—Ice Shipments—Marketing
Ice—Ice Wagons and Outfits.</p>
</div>

<p>After a house is filled with ice and put in order, it is placed
in the care of an attendant. The top dressing requires frequent
inspection to keep it intact. Keep the circulating air-chambers
in the walls in operation, except when the air is
humid; at such times the lower openings are closed. The loft
is ventilated directly into the cupola on top of the roof, which
also carries off the warm air currents rising through walls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Wasting of Ice.</span>—Ice in the house is attacked by
water, moisture, vapor, warm air and evaporation. Pressure
of the mass upon the lower courses assists in their destruction,
and heat from the earth is also radiated into them. Evaporation
goes on, to some extent, at all temperatures; its immediate
effect is cooling, as it carries off heat. Water rots and
wastes ice more rapidly than warm air. Water permeates the
mass and destroys the ice, while warm air affects only the
exposed surface. Vapor is wasteful when it settles down on
the ice and is condensed. Air currents, if they are strong, cut
away the ice very rapidly, and will sometimes comb the ice.</p>

<p>Keeping the room as air-tight as possible tends to preserve
the ice. Whenever the house is opened the warm air enters,
and vapor will collect above the ice. This should be given an
opportunity to escape, by opening the ventilator doors in the
loft floor.</p>

  <div class="caption">FIG. 57. DUNNAGE SHOVEL.</div></div>

<p>As the ice is taken from the house, the covering of sawdust
should be kept in place over the ice as far as possible. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the space over the ice is sealed up, the air, being above the
freezing point, becomes saturated with moisture, which settles
upon the ice, softening and melting it. When the outside air
is cooler than that over the ice or in the loft, the moist air is
driven out, if the ventilators are open. Hence, in clear
weather, the ventilators should be opened at night. In foggy
or damp weather, ventilators should be kept closed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Taking Out Ice</span> from the house, it is a good plan to
take out three tiers across the house at once. The upper tier
is worked a little in advance of the second, which is in advance
of the lower, or third, course. This gives a sloping front, on
which ice from the top can be lowered without breaking, and
work can progress on the three courses at the same time. The
covering can also be readily handled.</p>

<p>The tools employed are the house ice saw, raising-chisel
bar and striking-under bar. The saw has a narrow point,
with a double row of teeth for cutting down into the crevices
around the cakes, and a handle arranged to place pressure on
the point of the saw. The raising-chisel bar is used for cutting
around the sides. The striking-under bar is struck under the
bottom of the cake, to loosen it from the cake beneath. Where
ice has been packed in double cakes the hand ice plow is sometimes
employed to open the grooves, and the splitting chisel
for separating the cakes. The ice is run out to the door on
the house runs, or skids. The house tools not illustrated elsewhere
are shown below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lowering the Ice.</span>—There are several methods employed
for dropping the ice down from the top of the ice to the level
of the cars or wagons below. Gravity is the force usually
employed. Ice-gigs, with a counterweight to return the
empty gig to the level of the ice, are, in one form or another,
mostly in use. They can be mounted on a wheeled platform,
and moved from door to door, as desired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Packing for Shipment.</span>—When ice is loaded into cars it
is covered with marsh hay; any crevices at doors or windows
are carefully packed with hay, to keep out the air. Shavings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
and sawdust are also employed. When shipped to a distance,
the floors and sides of the cars are lined, and in the South each
cake is packed in sawdust and done up in burlap.</p>

<div id="il_58" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 23em;">
  <img src="images/i_059.jpg" width="1412" height="2640" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 58. LOWERING GIG AND TRACK.</div></div>

<p>When shipments are made in vessels, runs are set up from
the ice house, to discharge over the vessel’s rail. As the distance
is often considerable, the elevation of the runway is
high near the house, and if the ice is taken from the bottom
courses it is necessary, in some cases, to elevate the ice on to
the vessel runway. The ice can be lowered into the hold with
tongs. A gig, to take on two cakes at a time, handles the ice
with great celerity, a counterweight returning the gig to the
deck after the ice is discharged. Ice cakes are packed closely
in the hold, being trimmed to shape, when required. Six or
eight inches of sawdust are placed at the sides of the vessel,
and, perhaps, ten inches of short shavings on top. Hay can
be used, but sawdust is the best. Hatches are thoroughly
caulked, and the hold is not opened until the end of the trip.
The pumps must be sounded every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Marketing Ice</span>, painstaking supervision of details is
constantly required. Resources should always be in efficient
working order when required. A sudden hot spell often
doubles the demand for ice, and the utmost exertions will
hardly keep pace with it. Enterprise in extending trade should
not be overlooked, and the efficiency of the service rendered
is of special value in this direction. System and supervision
should be extended through every department.</p>

<p>In retailing ice, as conducted in the large cities of the
North, no detail of management is deemed trifling. Many ice
dealers take pride in having neat and convenient wagons for
their retail business. As a handsome wagon and a fine team
are the means of attracting favorable attention, so there is
nothing which causes more unfavorable comment than ill-kept
stock and untidy wagons.</p>

<p>The quality of ice used for domestic purposes is now
closely scrutinized, and cleanliness on the part of those handling
this commodity, is expected. Ice wagons are usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
furnished with an ice scale, an ice axe, several pairs of ice
tongs, an ice shave, a bucket, and sometimes a broom. The ice
cakes are cut as required, cleaned, weighed, and placed within
the customer’s refrigerator or ice box.</p>

<p>The use of coupon tickets is a great convenience. The
customer is furnished with a book at the beginning of the season,
and for each delivery of ice he receives, a ticket is given
back to the ice dealer. These tickets, having the name and
quantity indorsed on them, avoid errors and disputes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strength of Ice.</span>—Two inches in thickness of ice will
usually bear up a man, four inches in thickness a horse, and
ice five inches thick is generally safe for a team of horses and
a loaded wagon weighing two tons.</p>

<p>Eight inches in thickness will bear up 150 pounds per
square foot of surface, if distributed over an entire field.</p>

<p>Ten inches in thickness will support 250 pounds per square
foot of surface. It is usual to estimate that ice eighteen inches
thick will support a railway train.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weight of Ice.</span>—One cubic foot of ordinary ice will, on
the average, weigh fifty-seven and one-quarter pounds, while
a cubic foot of water weighs sixty-two and one-half pounds.</p>

<p>Thirty-six cubic feet of ice weigh 2,000 pounds. But as
stored in the house, it is reckoned that forty-two to fifty cubic
feet of space is required per ton of ice, depending upon the
thickness of the ice and the care with which it has been cut
and stored.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uses of Refrigeration</span> are numerous in these days
of invention and economy. The health, comfort and convenience
of the civilized world are so intimately interwoven with
results directly dependent upon the command, at will, of low
temperature, that it is now of paramount importance to
everyone.</p>

<p>Refrigeration in the commercial world is largely secured
by mechanical means, and this method will receive notice in a
later chapter. Cold storage, secured by ice, is in use all over
this country, for domestic and trade purposes in preserving
food products. The benefits of cold storage could be much
more widely diffused, than at present, throughout all the farming
communities, where ice forms naturally during the winter,
adding materially to their profits and convenience, and an
attempt is here made to show, in a practical way, how it can
be secured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Construction</span> of a cold storage ice house, and the
tools and methods employed for cutting and housing the ice,
as well as the benefits to be secured, will be considered. Only
such facts as have stood the test of practical experience, and
which are within the limits usually attained by those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
have good cold storage in use from year to year, will be presented.
These results are only attainable by properly constructed
storage houses, sufficient supply of ice, correct condition
of articles when placed in cool room, length of time they
are kept there and cleanliness. Cold storage houses, not built
on correct principles, or improperly used, will prove of little
account, and disappointment will follow their use.</p>

  <div class="caption">FIG. 61. A SIMPLE DELIVERY ICE WAGON.</div></div>

<p>Cold storage may be used to advantage in prolonging the
market for many products. The entire crop, of fruit in particular,
need not be shipped at once, but by proper picking
and storing shipping can be extended over several months.</p>

<p>Fresh meat can be enjoyed at will, and the lengthening of
the season during which many varieties of vegetables and
fruits can be kept fresh for the home table will not only add
to the health and enjoyment of the family, but it is in the line
of economy as well. Good health is the best doctor, and the
more generous living which cold storage brings within reach
is a precursor of health. In sickness a supply of ice and cooled
viands is often beyond price. The suffering its judicious use
may alleviate, and the numerous instances in which recovery
is impossible without it, commend a supply of so beneficent a
commodity to all. Ice is a necessity to health and comfort,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
and, as it can be readily secured in nearly all communities
within the frost belt, very few farmers should be without it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How Long Cold Storage will Preserve.</span>—No rules as
to the length of time during which various articles can be
kept in cold storage to the best advantage, can be given, which
will apply invariably to all cases. In stating what is often
done in this way it is intended to show what it has been found
profitable to do, and what will be likely to prove of practical
value to those who are starting in to make use of cold storage
for themselves. Poultry and fresh meats can be kept sweet
for two or three weeks. Beef is improved in quality by keeping
this length of time. Butter, eggs and lard may be stored
for three to eight months. Apples, according to variety and
condition, from five to ten months. Pears, pulled when they
will just come away from the stem, and carefully handled,
will keep two or three months. It is best to ship them in two
or three weeks, not waiting for color to mature, as this will be
perfected by the time they reach the consumer.</p>

<p>Concord grapes will keep two to four months in cold storage,
and Catawba grapes will keep longer.</p>

<p>Strawberries, blackberries and cherries will keep two to
four weeks.</p>

<p>Watermelons, three to six weeks.</p>

<p>Muskmelons, two to three weeks.</p>

<p>Peaches, four to six weeks.</p>

<p>Oranges, lemons, figs, bananas and raisins, two to three
months.</p>

<p>Green corn, two to four weeks.</p>

<p>Squash, four to eight weeks.</p>

<p>Cabbage and turnips, eight to nine months.</p>

<p>Potatoes may be kept a long time; they have been kept,
on a trial, several years, with no apparent loss of quality.
Canned fruits will keep well, and ice cream can be conveniently
stored.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Temperature</span> at which these results have been
secured varied from 34° to 38° F. Bananas, oranges, lemons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
peaches, figs and raisins do better at 40°. Peaches, pears, berries,
plums and all the more delicately flavored fruits keep in
good form and appearance, but lose their delicate flavor if
kept too long.</p>

<p>Fruits which are picked green, or before ripening, mature
or ripen while stored. The tendency to decay in ripe fruits is
arrested by refrigeration. Upon exposure to heat and air the
usual process goes on more rapidly than in foods which have
not been refrigerated. Food should enter into consumption
with little delay when taken out of cold storage. The length
of time during which it is desirable to keep goods in cold storage
may be best determined practically with reference to the
ends sought to be attained in any particular case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Principles of Cold Storage.</span>—Refrigeration depends
upon the circulation of pure, dry cold air. It is based
upon natural laws, which are well known and readily observed.
Air exposed to heat is expanded in volume; it is thus made
lighter and will rise, being forced upward by the surrounding
cooler air. Air exposed to cold is condensed and made heavier;
it will then gravitate to lower levels. The capacity of air
for absorbing and retaining moisture varies with its temperature.
Warm air will sustain a considerable amount of vapor,
which will be condensed and precipitated if the air is cooled.
As water is cooled and brought to the freezing point it expels
a large part of the heat gathered at a higher temperature. As
ice is melted to water this process is reversed, and heat and
air are reabsorbed.</p>

<p>The operation of these natural laws is taken advantage
of in refrigeration.</p>

<p>As usually constructed, cold storage ice houses are built
with two stories; the first floor for storing goods, the second
filled with ice. The floor between is arranged with openings,
through which the air, chilled by contact with the ice, descends
into the store room. A flue is provided to conduct the warm
air to the upper part of the ice chamber, when it is dried and
purified by contact with the ice as it descends on being chilled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Drains and traps are required to carry off the meltage water,
and to secure the water condensed from the warm air. Dampers
in the cold and warm air flues assist in controlling the
circulation, and ventilators placed in the roof keep the loft
free from dampness.</p>

<p>The walls, ground floor and ceiling are constructed as
nearly non-conducting of heat and cold as practicable. No
cracks or any channels are permissible by which air can enter.
Drains which take out the water are securely trapped, to keep
out the air. Vestibules with perfectly fitting doors are placed
at all entrances. Windows are fitted with three or four sashes
and air spaces between.</p>

<p>Dryness in the storage room is secured by a sheet metal
floor under the ice, usually galvanized iron, which forms a
large pan or vessel, in which
all meltage water is collected.
Water is very destructive to the
ice, and the warm air is kept
away from the top of the ice to
prevent the moisture from being
condensed there and settling on
the ice. When the ice is low in
the ice chamber, vapor may accumulate
in the space above the
ice. A ventilator in the top of
the room is of service in conducting
this away from the ice
and keeping it dry. The water
from the melted ice will absorb
air and gases so it is spread out
over as large a surface as practicable,
and the air is conducted
over it to be purified.</p>

  <div class="caption">FIG. 67. GROUND FLOOR.</div></div>

<p>There are several plans by which these general features
are observed, in the construction of cold storage houses, some
of which have been made the subject matter of patents.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
The plans shown in the illustrations embrace the essential
features of good cold storage construction. These plans do not
conflict with any patented devices, and will prove adequate for
all practical purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The General Arrangement of Cold Storage Houses</span>
may be, as shown in the illustrations, Figures <a href="#il_67">67</a>–<a href="#il_70">70</a>, for
any size. Large houses require a girder and posts under the
center of the ice floor, and the air flues are best made double;
one set at each side, with a drain on each side of the girder
along the center of the room. The construction of the walls
vary. Walls filled with sawdust, charcoal, tan bark or other
non-conducting materials, have been in use for many years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Carefully conducted tests, however, have conclusively proved
that a wall of this description is inferior to a wall which contains
dead air spaces, felt or paper linings, a section packed
with mineral wool and an outer circulating air space.</p>

<div id="il_70" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26em;">

  <div class="caption">FIG. 71. SECTION VIEW OF COMBINED ICE HOUSE AND DAIRY.</div></div>

<p>The wall shown in <a href="#il_69">Fig. 69</a> gives good satisfaction. It comprises
air spaces, <i>A</i>, which are open to the outer air at the sill,
and at the top open into the loft under the roof. Dampers <i>D</i>,
in <a href="#il_68">Fig. 68</a>, are placed at the bottom, so they can be closed when
desired. The next section, <i>B</i>, <a href="#il_69">Fig. 69</a>, is of dry sawdust, packed
in place between walls of matched boards; the outer surface
of these walls is lined with prepared water proof paper. The
inner section, <i>E</i>, contains dead air spaces, which are about
twelve inches square. The inner wall is of matched lumber
and the outer one is of weather boards.</p>

<p>This construction keeps the sawdust dry, and the walls are
free from dampness. The circulation of air through the outer
air spaces carries off the heat imparted to the weather boards
by the direct heat of the sun. When the air is humid, or
charged with moisture, these air channels are tightly closed.
The thickness of the walls may be varied with the capacity of
the building. Additional sections of filling and dead air are
required for large houses where large quantities of goods are
refrigerated. <a href="#il_67">Fig. 67</a> shows the ground floor.</p>

<p>The cold storage house shown in the illustration (<a href="#il_70">Fig. 70</a>)
will hold forty tons of ice, and do all the work required for
dairy, fruit and domestic service on a large farm with one filling
of ice. By regulating the dampers, <i>D D</i>, <a href="#il_68">Fig. 68</a>, the circulation
can be adjusted to meet all conditions. When these
dampers are closed the ice wastes very slowly. The waste
water, from meltage, is useful for cooling milk, and the milk
room and cooling vats can be placed alongside the storage
house or made a part of the same building to advantage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Creamery Ice House.</span>—A very conveniently arranged
and completely appointed creamery is shown in illustrations
No. 72 and 73. <a href="#il_72">Fig. 72</a> is a perspective view, and <a href="#il_73">Fig. 73</a> the
plan of a combined creamery, ice house and water tower.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
The tank <i>B</i> is placed in the second story of the tower; <i>C</i> is the
ice house, <i>D</i> the creamery. At <i>I I</i> are set creamers, which
are supplied with water from the tank by pipes passing
through the ice house to cool the water. At <i>G</i> is a churn,
which may be run by power located in the annex <i>E</i>. At <i>H</i> is
a butter molder, and <i>J</i> is the veranda.</p>

  <div class="caption">FIG. 73. GROUND PLAN OF CREAMERY.</div></div>

<p>By raising the ice chamber, a cold store room can be
secured below it. If the structure is placed on an elevation,
water from the tank can be piped through the dwelling house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Combined Dairy, Cold Storage and Ice House.</span>—Such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
an arrangement is shown in illustrations, Figs. <a href="#il_74">74</a> and <a href="#il_76">76</a>. There
is no communication between the dairy and storage room.
For securing ice for the tank, double doors, made to fit very
tight, are set in back of the ice chamber in the loft over the
dairy. As leaving this door ajar would rapidly waste the ice,
it should be under the care of a competent person and properly
secured.</p>

<p>Where the ice house and dairy are required without the
cold storage room, the plan shown in <a href="#il_71">Fig. 71</a> is a good one. If
a location on a sidehill is not conveniently at hand, the milk
room floor may be excavated sufficiently to secure proper fall
for drain. The floor of the ice house should be laid with
hydraulic cement, and slope toward the end nearest the milk
room. A cheaper floor is made from spent moulders’ sand or
coal ashes, mixed with enough lime to give a hard finish when
dry. This makes a hard, durable floor. The water in the tank
must be kept above the supply pipe from the ice house, to prevent
any ingress of warm air. A trap placed in this pipe is a
still better method. At <i>L</i>, <a href="#il_71">Fig. 71</a>, is a double door, through
which ice can be taken out for the tank if required.</p>

<p>The size of these rooms can be taken at convenience. The
ice house should not be less than twelve feet square and
twelve feet high. Any smaller quantity than this wastes the
ice much more rapidly. A house sixteen feet square and
twelve feet high is a safe size for a dairy which is served by
forty cows or less. The lumber for walls is better if matched,
and the studding lined with paper. They are, however, often
built from rough lumber, with no air spaces. The packed section
should be ten inches in such cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Freezing House.</span>—In some instances it is required to
have a freezing temperature in the cold storage room. Poultry,
dressed and frozen, and shipped in tight cases, has given
good returns. This low temperature is secured by means of
galvanized sheet iron tanks, Figs. <a href="#il_75">75</a>, <a href="#il_77">77</a>, <a href="#il_78">78</a>, which are packed
with broken ice and salt. From the surface of these tanks the
cold is radiated directly into the room; hence, the larger the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
surface of the tanks for a given capacity of ice and salt, the
better, because of the large radiating surface.</p>

<div id="il_74" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38em;">
  <img src="images/i_074.jpg" width="2424" height="1203" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 74. COLD STORAGE HOUSE COMBINED WITH DAIRY.</div></div>

<p>The best form for the tanks is that of a hollow parallelogram.
The lower edge should set about eighteen inches above
the floor, to allow a circulation of air through the center of
the tank. The tank should be a little wider at the bottom than
at the top. This prevents the ice and salt from lodging. A
tank six feet high, sixteen feet long, and three feet wide,
placed at one side of the storage room shown in <a href="#il_68">Fig. 68</a>,
and regularly supplied with ice and salt, will reduce the temperature
of the room nearly to O° F. As long as the supply of
ice and salt is maintained, this low temperature can be held.
The tanks are furnished with a trap to carry off the water,
placed at the lowest end, and hand holds are arranged through
which the salt which accumulates at the bottom may be
removed. A drip pan is set beneath the tanks to catch all
drippings of condensation; these pans are of wood, lined with
metal, and provided with a pipe to carry off the water.</p>

<div id="il_75" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_075.png" width="1486" height="716" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 75. SECTION OF REFRIGERATING TANK.</div></div>

<p>Frost and ice accumulate on the surface of these cooling
tanks, and their usefulness is thereby impaired. Duplicate
tanks should be arranged, so that they may be used in turn,
and the ice removed. The ice coat prevents the radiation of
the cold into the room, and its force is spent in adding to the
ice upon the sides of the tank, a useless waste.</p>

<p>In some instances the cold storage houses are divided into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
two or more rooms, so that various temperatures can be maintained
to meet the requirements of a varied stock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Very Cheap Ice House</span>, but constructed on the same
principles as those laid down in Chapter IV for commercial
ice houses, may take the form suggested by Figs. <a href="#il_79">79</a>, <a href="#il_80">80</a>, <a href="#il_81">81</a>, or
any desired modification thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Still Simpler Device.</span>—Where the expense of an ice
house is not warranted by the small use to which it may be
put for cold storage, on some farms, a supply of ice sufficient
for household purposes can be placed in any convenient corner
of a barn or other building. A room partitioned off with
rough lumber, and walls, as well as floor, well insulated with
non-conducting filling, will answer, and repay its cost many
times over during the summer. In <a href="#il_82">Fig. 82</a> is a view of an ice
room built into a corner of a barn in this manner.</p>

<p>An above-ground silo, if built of wood, with double walls
and air spaces, will make a most excellent ice house, if provided
with double doors. The underground, or masonry silo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
should be boarded up, with joists between walls, and boards
to form an air space, if used for ice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Little Organized Co-operation</span> in any farming community
where ice-cutting privileges exist, will secure an
abundant supply of ice for all purposes for the entire section

power, where only very extensive farmers find it profitable to
have an outfit for their own exclusive use.</p>

<p>SUGGESTIONS FOR CHEAP ICE HOUSES.</p></div></div>

<p>In a similar manner the benefits of cold storage can be
obtained. The houses can be owned by individuals, or by a
few families who may be living near enough together to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
conveniently use one in common. The tools and outfit for cutting
and handling the ice can be owned by a few enterprising young
men, who can fill a large number of houses yearly by contract;
or the appliances can be the joint property of all those having
cold storage houses, who may combine to secure them, and
also combine their labor in securing the ice crop. This work
is done when the ordinary duties of the farm are light, and
other interests would not be interfered with.</p>

<p>The practical advantages of this plan will readily present
themselves to observing minds. An outfit of tools necessary
to harvest, in good
shape, one hundred tons
of ice, will just as well
harvest ten or fifteen
times this quantity, and
would really secure the
larger quantity to better
advantage than the
smaller one. But, allowing
that the labor in
getting out one hundred
tons of ice is the same per ton that it is for one thousand tons,
the cost of the tools per ton of ice harvested is only one tenth
as much in the latter case. The tools are durable, and will last
many years. Ice plows which have been in use for fifteen or
twenty years are still doing good service.</p>

<p>As the cold storage houses would be situated at several
places, a brief outline of the methods in use for handling ice
under similar circumstances, will be of interest. The ice is
transported from the water to the houses by wagons or sleds.
A platform is built near the edge of the water, in an easily
accessible place, of a height a little above the bed of wagon
boxes when they are backed up to the platform. The end of
this platform is toward the water, and the teams are backed
in on both sides. From the water end an inclined way or run
is built down into the water. Upon this run the ice cakes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
rapidly run up on the platform, quickly loaded on the wagons,
and started on their way to the storage houses. Arriving at
its destination, the load of ice may be deposited on the ground
at the entrance of the house, and the team returned for another
load. Meanwhile two men, with the assistance of a horse, can
stow the first load in place in the ice chamber.</p>

<p>For such work the tools required on the ice field comprise:</p>

<p class="in0 in2">
One ice plow with guide.<br />
One ice saw.<br />
One ice chisel.<br />
One ice floating hook, twelve to twenty feet long.<br />
Three ice hooks, short lengths.<br />
One jack grapple.<br />
Two pairs of loading tongs.
</p>

<p class="in0">At the ice house are required:</p>

<p class="in0 in2">
One pair hoisting tongs.<br />
One pair drag tongs.<br />
One pair edging tongs.
</p>

<p>At this time the cash value of these tools is about sixty-five
dollars for first-class goods, which are always the cheapest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cost of Ice in the House.</span>—Regarding the cost of ice
when stowed in place in the ice chamber, it would be difficult
to quote an amount which would cover all cases. Locality
and tact have much to do with determining this cost. Ice,
twelve to sixteen inches thick, cut in small quantities and
placed in the ice chamber, would cost, on an average, for
labor, about fifty cents per ton. Where cut on a large scale
the cost for labor in cutting and stowing is less than half of
this amount.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Loading Platform</span> is illustrated in <a href="#il_83">Fig. 83</a>, which shows
the method of running the ice cakes up with a jack grapple.
The size of the platform is determined by the quantity of ice
to be handled over it. One horse and grapple will readily
serve several teams if a supply of ice cakes is maintained at
the foot of the incline. Where many teams are to be served
and the ice must be handled rapidly, two grapplers, one right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
and one left hand, can be used on the incline. By having the
rope continuous and a pulling post at each end of the horse
walk, the horse will pull a load each way, and several hundred
tons of ice can be landed upon the platform in a day’s run.
Where the incline is long a team can be used to advantage on
the grapple rope.</p>

<p>A sweep such as shown in <a href="#il_85">Fig. 85</a> is a convenience in handling
ice cakes directly from the water to sleds or wagons where
only a small quantity is wanted, and where the ice platform is
not required. A similar device, which has the advantage of
being more readily moved, is shown at <a href="#il_86">Fig. 86</a>. Where an artificial
pond is made with an embankment, a loading platform
may be constructed, as shown in <a href="#il_84">Fig. 84</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Packing the Ice</span> into the ice chamber, attention is
required to prevent any dirt from adhering to the ice and
being packed into the ice chamber, where it will accumulate
in the drains and on the floors as the ice melts.</p>

<p>At <i>S</i>, in <a href="#il_68">Fig. 68</a>, will be found an opening over the drip
pan; through these openings, placed at convenience along the
back of the floor, the floor can be flushed with water and
washed clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>Time, labor and convenience are all conserved by the use
of such necessary tools as are listed on previous pages. More
can be added as the amount of ice cut is increased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ice Field</span> should be kept free from snow by scraping
from time to time. For clearing the small surface from which
a harvest of forty tons can be secured, a simple scraper,
cheaper than those used on large fields, will answer the purpose.
An oak plank one and one-half inches thick, ten inches
wide and six feet long, with two holes four inches from the
bottom edge, and four feet apart, and a foot board mortised
through the center, will do tolerable work. An iron shoe on
the lower edge adds materially to its efficiency. <a href="#il_80">Fig. 80</a> illustrates
a scraper of this pattern.</p>

<p>Thirty-six cubic feet of ice weigh a ton. Hence, a surface
six feet square on an ice field, where the ice is a foot thick,
represent a ton of ice. At this rate a surface thirty-eight feet
square would represent forty tons of ice. Owing to loss by
breakage, and irregular cutting, it is usual to allow a considerable
margin, greater in small than in large quantities, and a
surface fifty feet square would readily harvest forty tons of
twelve-inch ice. Where the ice is thinner a correspondingly
larger surface is required to secure the same weight of ice.</p>

<p>The surface being cleared of snow, the ice plow is set upon
the ice alongside a line drawn taut in the direction in which
the plowing is to be done. The ice plow, drawn by hand and
guided to run parallel with the line, gives the base groove.
The blade of the guide is placed in this groove, and the field is
now grooved in uniform spaces in one direction. The plow
makes only one cut in each groove, while the guide is attached
to it. By repeating this method grooves are made crossing
those first made at right angles. The guide is now removed
from the plow, and by plowing back and forth the ice is
grooved to the depth desired, about seven or eight inches for
twelve-inch ice and two inches for six-inch ice.</p>

<p>A channel is now opened at the foot of the incline, and a
few hours work for four men, and a boy driving the horse to
run the grapple, will land the ice cakes on the platform.</p>

<p>Historical Sketch—The First Ice Machine—Its Subsequent
Development—Progress in the Use of Machines—The
Principles Involved in their Construction—Diversity of
Application—Recent Discoveries.</p>
</div>

<p>The artificial production of cold has engaged attention
from remote ages. The application of spontaneous evaporation
in Eastern countries was the earliest method employed to
produce ice.</p>

<p>America has the honor of being the home of the inventors
who first achieved success in making artificial ice by modern
methods. Jacob Perkins, in 1834, and Professor Twinning, of
New Haven, Conn., in 1850, each procured British patents.
The former did not procure a patent in this country, but Professor
Twinning secured one in 1853. Two years later, he had
a machine in operation at Cleveland, Ohio, which produced
1,600 pounds of ice in twenty-four hours’ run. This was a
favorable result from a pioneer machine of an estimated capacity
of 2,000 pounds in this time.</p>

<p>Much credit is due these early inventors, who introduced
a type of machine which is now extensively employed, and is
known as the compression system.</p>

<p>In 1851, Dr. John Gorrie, of New Orleans, La., patented a
machine for producing ice, by compressing and expanding
atmospheric air. This machine was also the pioneer of its
class. It gave rise to what are known as air machines, used
in England and on the Continent, and extensively employed
for facilitating the transportation of fresh beef and mutton on
the ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>In 1848, Ferdinand Carré, of France, contrived an original
process for employing aqua ammonia. In 1865 he patented an
ice machine, and at the French International Exposition, in
1867, daily produced six tons of ice. This has proved to be a
notable invention, the present absorption system being based
upon it and extensively used.</p>

<p>Efforts have been directed to expediting the spontaneous
evaporation of water; a reduction of pressure being effected
by a vacuum pump, and the vapors removed by a suitable
absorbing medium. The utilization of cold obtained by the
evaporation of other liquids, more volatile than water, have
received attention.</p>

<p>There have been discovered a number of freezing mixtures,
some of which produce wonderfully low temperatures.
The addition of salt to broken ice is the best known of these;
it is commonly employed in making ice creams and ices, and
is of great commercial importance as applied to refrigerator
cars and cold storage houses.</p>

<p>Of all these methods the compression, absorption and air
machines, and the freezing mixture of ice and salt, have
entered into commercial uses in this country. The details of
the latter method are referred to in Chapter VI. Regarding
the others, some account of the principal operations involved,
and of the natural phenomena upon which they are based,
will be given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Principles of Ice Machines.</span>—It has been observed of
gases, that by compressing them to a fraction of their original
volume, heat was produced. If the compression was great,
most gases were liquified by it. A few gases were found
which would not liquify, and were designated as permanent.
By relieving the pressure, gases will resume their original
bulk, and the heat of compression is gathered up or reabsorbed
by them.</p>

<p>There is, naturally, a constant tendency toward the preservation
of an equilibrium of temperature among the atoms of
any body, and also between different bodies. This exchange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
is carried on upon a grand scale, in the economy of nature.
Where the difference in degree is small the exchange is
effected slowly, but where it is great the initial transfers proceed
rapidly and with vigor.</p>

<p>By means of efficient insulation we can cut off, in a great
measure, a room, or a part of a room, from the influence of
the outer, or general exchanges of temperature. By this
means we are able to bring this natural law into service, by
controlling the exchanges of temperature of the objects we
place in such rooms.</p>

<p>By the union of heat with a fluid, the latter is converted
into a vapor, and the abstraction of heat from a gas converts
it into a liquid. When a fluid or a gas is at the temperature
at which a change in its condition is effected, the continued
application or withdrawal of heat does not increase or diminish
this temperature. This heat is termed latent, or hidden.
The temperature at which ebullition takes place varies greatly
with different liquids. Water boils at 212° F., while ammonia
boils at 32° F. Some substances act as absorbents. Water
will absorb about seven hundred times its bulk of ammonia
gas when they are brought in contact.</p>

<p>In manufacturing low temperatures, by the Compression
and Absorption systems, a liquifiable gas is used as the vehicle
by which to impart cold to, and carry off heat from, the body
to be cooled. Anhydrous-ammonia (ammonia from which all
water has been removed) is usually employed. In the Compression
machines, this gas is subjected to a pressure, averaging
one hundred and fifty pounds per square inch, in a compression
cylinder against a piston, which is operated by a
steam engine. The heated gas is carried to a set of condenser
coils, which are cooled by a water bath; here the gas is liquified
by the reduction of temperature and the pressure. By
this process it is made to part with the heat of compression,
and its latent heat of vaporization, as well. The liquid
ammonia is collected in a storage tank, and is then ready for
refrigeration duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>From this point the Compression and Absorption systems
are practically identical. The liquid ammonia is allowed to
escape through a valve with a minute opening, into what are
termed the expansion coils. As the ammonia enters it is freed
from about three-fourths of the pressure at which it has been
held, and begins to boil and vaporize. As heat is necessary to
accomplish this, everything within reach of its influence is
placed under tribute. As the gas parted with about five hundred
and seventy heat units per pound at the condenser, its
capacity for heat is now very large.</p>

<p>The expansion coils may be placed in a loft of a cold storage
room in the same position in which ice is placed for this
duty. If they are submerged in a brine solution, the brine is
cooled, and may be circulated in galvanized iron gutters suspended
from the ceiling of the storage rooms.</p>

<p>After circulating through the expansion coils, the gas is
drawn out and forced again into the compression cylinder by
a pump which renders the system a continuous one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Making Artificial Ice</span>, the expansion tubes may be
submerged directly in the water which is to be frozen; the ice
forms in huge cakes on the tubes, and is sawed into small
cakes by a circular saw, when removed. This is termed the
plate system.</p>

<p>In the can plan, a large tank holds the expansion tubes,
and, suspended from its upper side, are numerous iron cans; a
brine solution completely fills the tank, and, being chilled by
the tubes, it gradually freezes the water which has been placed
in the cans for this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Absorption System</span>, aqua ammonia is placed in a
retort containing a coil of steam pipes. A mixed vapor of
water and ammonia is driven off, until sufficient pressure is
developed in the retort to force the vapor through a small pipe
into a condensing tank. Here the gas is cooled and liquified,
and also rectified, or freed from water, making it anhydrous.
The liquid passes into a receiving tank, and is then used for
refrigerator work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>This duty is performed in the same manner as described
for the compression machine. From the expansion coils the
gas is returned to a tank called the absorber, where the water
left behind at the condenser has also been sent; here they are
reunited, and then pumped again into the retort, to begin the
round anew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Air Machines</span>, this gas is compressed in a cylinder
against a piston, which is driven by a steam engine. The
compressed air is cooled by water jets sprayed in the compression
cylinder, and also in a cooling tank which has a water
bath passed over it at the same time.</p>

<p>The condensed moisture is deposited in the cooling tank
and in drying tubes, which are exposed to the spent air which
has done refrigeration duty, and is still cool enough to further
lower the temperature of the compressed air. After being
dried, the air is expanded, producing an intense cold. This
air can be circulated in tubes, or used for cooling brine, as in
the methods already mentioned, or the air can be expanded
directly into the storage rooms or ice tanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Large Plant for the Storage of Fruit</span> is situated
at Waldo, Fla., and is controlled by the American ice and cold
storage company. It is illustrated in <a href="#il_88">Fig. 88</a>. A perfectly
dry, cool atmosphere is maintained, and a temperature so
uniform as to demand only one degree of variation. The temperature
at which the rooms have to be kept varies from
33° to 45° F., depending on the character of the fruit which is
to be stored. The higher temperatures are preferable, if sufficiently
low to preserve the fruit. Retarding houses for keeping
oranges or the more delicate fruits, can usually be more
successfully managed by the use of refrigerating machinery,
as it is not always possible to maintain a sufficiently even and
low temperature by means of ice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Latest Inventions.</span>—All these ice-making and cold
air machines are more or less expensive and complicated.
It is natural, therefore, that inventors should be constantly
seeking some plan, idea or method, for securing a low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
temperature at less cost for the plant involved. The expense of
the existing systems also prevents their use, except on a large
scale; hence inventors are striving to find not only a method of
producing cold at low cost, but one that can be adapted for
use in houses, offices, stores, shops, cars, etc., on a more or
less limited scale. Several devices for this purpose have
already been patented. Some of them promise good results,
though at this writing none seem to be thoroughly perfected.
One of these devices employs a gas jet, or lamp light, the heat
from which, acting on a kettle filled with chemical compound,
produces a low temperature for a small house refrigerator,
while the same principle is claimed to be applicable on a
larger scale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uses of Artificial Refrigeration</span> are numerous.
For cooling and ventilating buildings, aiding in some lines of
manufactures, and in chemical works, it has proved its usefulness.
In all hot climates it is extensively employed for making
ice. In breweries it is applied very extensively, and is
practically indispensable.</p>

<p>The handling of fresh meat, in the modern method, is
directly dependent upon artificial refrigeration, and in no
other direction are its benefits more marked or widespread.
The cattle on our Western plains have become the daily food
of those living at the antipodes. In ten years, from 1880 to
1891, the imports of fresh beef and mutton into Great Britain
increased from 400 to nearly 3,300,000 carcasses. During the
same period the exports of beef alone from the United States
advanced from 50,500 tons to 101,500 tons.</p>

<p>Not only are meats carried in refrigerator vessels from
America and the antipodes to England, but within a year
Australian milk has been shipped in frozen blocks in such
quantities as to be retailed in the streets of London for four
cents per quart. Butter, cheese, eggs, fruits and other perishable
products, are likewise transported enormous distances by
rail or water, without injury to the quality, and at a low cost
for freight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>It is also worthy of mention that refrigeration is now
employed by the engineer, in substructure work in soils
abounding in quicksands. A solid wall of earth is frozen and
maintained in such soils, within which excavating and construction
can proceed with ease and safety.</p>

<p>That many other uses for refrigeration will be developed
goes without question. The students and inventors who are
engaged on the problems involved in the production of artificial
cold, claim that before many years all modern houses
will be supplied with a refrigerating outfit in the garret to
supply cold air to any of the rooms in summer, by gravity,
as hot air is carried by flues from the furnace in winter.
The universal application of a practical device for this purpose,
will yield a rich reward for the successful inventor.</p>

<p>Refrigerator Cars and Vessels—Value of Ice in Transporting
and Marketing Perishable Produce—Ice and the Fisheries.</p>
</div>

<p>On all the important lines of railroads a regular refrigerator
car service is maintained, for transporting perishable
goods of all kinds. Butter, poultry, eggs, cheese, fruit, fresh
meat, vegetables, and other articles, are despatched by this
service. The shipping of packing-house products is an important
branch of this department of railroad service, and a
description of it will show the general features common to all
branches of the business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Refrigerator Cars.</span>—A cursory view of the cars in any
freight yard discloses a decided difference in the appearance
and thoroughness of construction among them. Those styled
refrigerator cars fare very much better than their companions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
A critical examination shows that these cars are models in all
details of construction, and their finish casts the ordinary
freight cars far in the shade.</p>

<p>The main features of these cars are found, first, in their
walls, including floors and ceilings, which are variously made
of combinations of filled and air sections, with paper and felt
linings; second, an ice tank placed, sometimes at one, or both
ends, and in others in the roof of the car; third, in the regulation
of the air supply, or ventilation. Some very elaborate
designs have been made, covering the features necessary to
the successful working of these cars. Most of them are
patented. The floor, ceiling and walls have several sections,
the outer being usually an air space, or a space filled with
thick hair felt. Following is a compartment filled with pulverized
charcoal, or other non-conducting filling. This compartment
is faced with carefully matched lumber lined with
paper. The walls are about six inches thick all together.</p>

<p>The doors are the same thickness as the walls, with beveled
edges, which wedge into the frame as the door is closed.
A fastening is used that is so made that a strong pressure is
brought against the door, forcing it into its seat, and an extra
precaution taken by inserting a strip of cotton flannel between
the door and frame, which thoroughly excludes air and dust.</p>

<p>In the best constructed cars there is no chance for direct
contact of the cooled air with the ice. This of special is
importance in cars in which fresh meat, butter, and other articles,
are carried, which are absorbents.</p>

<p>Where the ice tank is located in the roof of the car, the
circulation of air is secured by gravity, and is changed by
admission of air through an opening so arranged that a
draft is created by the motion of the car. Very fine brass
wire cloth is doubled over these openings, to exclude the dust;
as the air enters, it is discharged against a water surface,
which catches the fine dust carried through the screens. The
waste water is discharged through a trap, which effectually
shuts off the entrance of air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>When the ice tanks are placed at the ends of the car
gravity will not maintain a circulation of air. As the ice
melts, the upper strata of air remains warm. To avoid this
feature, resource is had in a forced draft. The air in the
upper part of the car is collected by a fan and forced through
tubes extending through the ice tanks and opening on to the
floor of the car. In connection with the fan is an inlet and
outlet tube, by which a gradual change of air is effected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ventilating Refrigerator Cars.</span>—In some cars there is
no provision for renewal of the air; the object is, no doubt,
economy of ice, and for very low temperature, or for short
trips, it is an advantage which does not have any ill effects on
the contents of the car. For long trips and moderate temperatures,
a change of air is beneficial, in most instances.</p>

<p>In some cars, ventilation is so arranged that the air can be
changed or not, as desired. The fans are run by motion taken
from one of the car axles, and are arranged to be run by hand
when the car is not in motion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Icing Refrigerator Cars.</span>—When a train is to be loaded
with beef or mutton, it is set in on a track alongside of the
icing platform. By means of double tracks on either side, as
many as fifty cars can be iced at short notice. Ice cakes are
delivered on a staging above the platform by elevator, suited
to the location, and run into the hopper of a large power ice
breaker. Barrows, of a capacity of five hundred pounds of
broken ice, are set below the breaker, and, by withdrawing the
damper, are filled with ice. From two to four shovelfuls of
salt are added, and the barrow is dumped into the mouth of a
chute which runs along the edge of the platform, delivering
the ice directly into the door above the ice tank. About four
tons of ice are placed in each car. By an extension spout the
cars are filled in the same manner on the farther tracks.
After icing, the cars are loaded, and at intervals on their
journey the ice is replenished.</p>

<p>In shipping other goods, which are not wanted below the
freezing point, ice is used without salt. Even with such goods,
the more frequent use of ice would often be advisable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Value of Ice in Transportation.</span>—It is difficult to imagine
the state of affairs which would ensue upon a withdrawal
of all refrigerator service upon our railways. The amount of
privation and actual suffering which would follow would be
felt directly in every community in the land. To most people
the blessings which follow in the wake of the refrigerator car
are of a kind which are accepted without question, as a matter
of course. It would be a long list, to enumerate all the
advantages which are now mutually divided between the producer
and the consumer of the products of our farms, gardens,
vineyards, dairies and fisheries, dependent, in whole or in part,
upon this service.</p>

<p>It is but a short time since hundreds of bushels of fruit
were left to decay on the ground in California orchards, while
many other sections were destitute of fruit. Now a refrigerator
car service delivers these fruits at all the Atlantic coast
cities, as well as points between. Trial shipments have been
despatched to London, with gratifying results, and it is more
than probable that large quantities of the products of these
famous orchards will delight our cousins across the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Refrigerator Vessels.</span>—On board the fastest steamships
plying between our Atlantic ports and Europe, are found
extensive refrigerator compartments. Dressed beef and mutton
are exported in large quantities, as well as fruits, vegetables,
dairy products and oysters. The temperature, for meat,
is maintained a few degrees below the freezing point. Air
machines are principally used on the ocean, the brisk circulation
of air which they maintain being an advantage. The enormous
quantities of dressed meat transported from the United
States, Argentine, New Zealand and Australia, to Europe,
requires a large fleet of steamers, some of which are equipped,
at considerable expense, for this special service. In connection
with these vessels, at both shipping and receiving wharfs,
are large storehouses, where the frozen meat is held, awaiting
shipment, or received after its voyage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Transporting Fruit on the Ocean</span>, a large fleet find
employment; in it are found steamers built with insulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
hulls formed by lining the outer steel hull with wood and packing
the inclosed space with powdered charcoal. Refrigerator
service is essential to success in transporting the more delicate
fruits such as pears, peaches, cherries and plums which have
been landed in London from California and South Africa in
excellent condition in this way.</p>

<p>Ventilation, in connection with insulated hulls, is depended
on in handling most of the tropical fruits imported into this
country. Bananas from Central and South American and
West India ports form the staple commodity, giving employment
to an extensive fleet of very excellent boats. From
Southern Europe large quantities of fruit are exported,
oranges, lemons, grapes and nuts forming the bulk of the
shipments which are carried in steamers in well ventilated
compartments.</p>

<p>The development of the fruit traffic from different districts
is attaining huge proportions with the control of the proper
conditions for transit which shippers now have within their
reach. Fruit shipments are now made to England from Florida
and California, Southern Europe, South Africa and Australia.
The shipments from one land forming the complement of those
from others, a continual supply of the finest fresh fruits is
available.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ice in the Fisheries.</span>—It is now long ago that fresh fish
were to be enjoyed only at places near by the fishing grounds.
Now they are in the market the year round. During the season
when fish may be caught, those not entering into immediate
consumption are placed in cold storage rooms and frozen, to be
taken out at any later time as they are wanted. Such storage
houses are found in connection with all important fishing stations
on the New England coast, along the great lakes, and
among the salmon fisheries of the Northern Pacific. When
the fishing boats start on a cruise they are loaded with ice, with
which the fish are preserved, and the fishermen are not obliged
to return home with a small catch to prevent its spoiling.</p>

<p>In shipping fish to inland places, a beautiful sight is often
observed in a slab of crystal ice about three feet square and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
eight inches thick, within which a dozen or more fish have
been frozen. They are as beautiful in appearance as when
seen in their native element, while no occasion exists for commenting
upon the utility of this method of transporting them.
Altogether ice is a prime necessity in this business in all
departments—the fisherman, the shipper and dealer, and the
consumer.</p>

<p>It would not do to close this chapter without referring
to the oyster. The association of oysters and ice are so intimate
that they are usually seen together. The trays of oysters
and ice may be seen in every direction during the season, on
their way from the oyster beds to delight the palates of their
admirers who are found everywhere.</p>

<p>Cold Storage in Modified Form, Without Ice—Ventilated Storage
and Packing Houses for Fruit and other Produce.</p>
</div>

<p>It is well known that cellars which are dry, cool and well
ventilated are of great service in preserving fruit and vegetables.
In Sicily, where oranges have long been produced in
great quantities, they are kept in cool caves, which are numerous
among the mountains of that island. Its volcanic origin
no doubt has particularly favored their formation, and the porous
nature of the rock insures ventilation combined with a dry
cool air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caves for Storage.</span>—There is much of the natural phenomena
of caves which is interesting, and definite determination of
their philosophy would be of value. There are caves in which
ice is formed during the hottest weather, and in which it disappears
during the winter.</p>

<p>Shafts sunk in mining have exhibited the same peculiarity.
The even temperature and dryness of the air in many caves is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
remarkable. While the facts are yet to be determined scientifically
regarding these natural formations, some of their characteristics
may be secured by artificially constructed cellars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Storage Cellars Without Ice</span> have been in use for years,
with profit and convenience to their owners. A convenient
place is to locate them in the side of a slight hill, as shown in
<a href="#il_89">Fig. 89</a>. A cross section is shown in <a href="#il_90">Fig. 90</a>. An excavation
the width of the cellar is made, the earth being thrown up
against the outside of the stone wall, which is built on the
lower hillside. The opposite wall is formed by the cut face of
the hill. The rear end is constructed in the same manner as
the lower hillside. The front wall and doors are made of a
double thickness of boards, with six inches inclosed space filled
with sawdust.</p>

<div id="il_89" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_097.png" width="1717" height="774" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 89. PERSPECTIVE VIEW OF FRUIT CELLAR.</div></div>

<p>The doors swing inward, and are large enough to admit a
single horsecart. The sides and rear end are lined with inch
boards. The side walls are four feet high in the clear. To
form the roof, boards are cut of a length which will raise the
center seven feet above the floor and give easy passage for a
horse.</p>

<p>Midway between the center and either wall a 2 × 4 post is
set upon a footing of brick, and above it under the roof boards
a 1 × 4 strip is run the length of the cellar. On top of the first
roof boards a layer of straw is placed, which will be a foot in
thickness when pressed down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>On top of this straw a second set of roof boards is placed,
covered with another layer of straw; on top is now placed a
tight cover of matched boards, and two thicknesses of tarred
paper over the whole. Battens are placed over the joints in
the matched boards to hold down the tarred paper and prevent
any water passing through. The outer edges of the roof are
set firmly against the ground at the top of the walls.</p>

<p>On the upper hillside tiling should be placed, or other draining
to carry off the surface water. A porous, gravelly side
should be selected whenever available. In the front two windows
are placed and one large one at the rear, double sashes
being fitted during the coldest weather.</p>

  <div class="caption">FIG. 90. CROSS SECTION OF FRUIT CELLAR.</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Cheapness and Capacity of such a Cellar.</span>—For a
cellar one hundred feet deep the estimated cost is $100, no
skilled labor being required. Rough lumber is used except for
the last roof boards. Large storage room is provided in such
a cellar, fifty thousand celery plants have been accommodated
in one; hundreds of bushels of vegetables, apples and other
fruits have been held in it during the fall and winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Cold Packing House.</span>—On large fruit farms a building
designed to properly care for the fruit during shipping and
packing, and as a store house for temporary use, is desirable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
The illustrations below (Figs. <a href="#il_91">91</a> and <a href="#il_92">92</a>) are taken from a ventilated
fruit house with insulated walls, which has operated very
successfully in Ontario County, N. Y. A perspective view is
shown in <a href="#il_91">Fig. 91</a>. The main building is 24 × 36 feet, built into a
slight hill. The basement is built with stone walls eighteen
inches thick, extending two feet below the surface and rising
six feet above it.</p>

<p>The floor is made of eight inches of clean coarse gravel,
with a coat of hydraulic cement grouted in a finishing coat on
top, thus making a dry, hard floor.</p>

<div id="il_91" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_099.jpg" width="1703" height="1010" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 91. PERSPECTIVE VIEW OF FRUIT HOUSE.</div></div>

<p>The basement is divided into convenient apartments. The
entrance is from the front and north sides, the floor being
almost level with the outside surface. Both the doors and
windows are double, the latter being provided with screens to
keep out insects when open for ventilation. This basement is
ceiled with inch boards, on top of which, between the joists, is
placed an inch and one-half of mortar.</p>

<p>The upper building is fourteen feet to the eaves, the main
story being eight feet in the clear. The studding is five inches
wide, and on the outside are two thicknesses of damp-proof
paper, over which weather boards are placed. On the inside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
of the studding are two layers of paper, then a two-inch wide
studding on which the paper is again doubled; over this comes
matched inch lumber, making two dead air spaces to insure
against the changes of outside temperature affecting that on
the inside.</p>

<p>The ceiling of this room is formed by putting one thickness
of paper on the joists, covered with matched lumber.
The floor is of matched two-inch plank, thus making dead air
spaces between the cellars and the upper room, and also rendering
it impervious to rats and mice. (<a href="#il_92">Fig. 92</a>.)</p>

<p>This floor is occupied by an office and stairway in one end,
and these leave a clear floor space of 24 × 24 feet, for storing
and packing purposes. Shelves,
thirty-two inches deep, are placed
all around the wall of this room,
and are capable of holding about
seven tons of grapes or other
fruits, leaving the center for such
as are in barrels.</p>

<p>From the east side of this
room a door opens into the raised
portion of the shed. Through this
door the fruit can be unloaded
from the wagon without any lifting.
This shed runs the whole
length of the building and is sixteen
feet wide, with a ground floor.
It is ample to accommodate packing,
also several loads of fruit over night or through a shower.</p>

<div id="il_92" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 13em;">
  <img src="images/i_100.png" width="775" height="1054" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">FIG. 92. SECTION OF FLOOR AND CEILING.</div></div>

<p>The top story is eight feet high in the center. The floor is
one-inch matched stuff, laid on paper. The sides and ceiling
are lathed and plastered. It makes a cool room, pleasant to
work in or to store grapes and other fruits in baskets, as the
veranda on the west side has a flat roof with a door opening on
it, which renders it very convenient for loading or unloading.
The veranda is six feet wide on the two sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>A galvanized iron ventilating tube, two feet in diameter,
runs from the fruit to above the roof, to carry off the heated
air. Other ventilating doors should be close to the floor and
left open at night, thus making a cool draft all night through
the fruit room. The doors are to be closed air-tight early in
the morning; the room above can be ventilated through the
shaft all day, drawing off the heat from the roof.</p>

<p>Pure air and plenty of it being required in a house of this
description, its location should be well chosen. The prevailing
winds and surrounding buildings or other features can be
noticed in selecting a site.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Removing Fruit</span> from storage room, it is always desirable
to let the temperature gradually rise to that of the external
atmosphere. Otherwise the fruit, being removed at once
from a cool room, being cooler than the external atmosphere,
condenses moisture on its surface which, unless removed, may
cause decay after the fruit is packed for shipment or sale.</p>

<p>Recipes for Iced Foods and Drinks—Ice Creams of every Sort
and Description—Fruit Mashes, Sherbets and the like—Other
Iced Dishes.</p>
</div>

<p>There are few who do not thoroughly enjoy a dish of well
made ice cream or a glass of some refreshing iced beverage.</p>

<p>The addition of an ice house to the farm equipment is the
connecting link which will supply these luxuries. Few entertainments
are complete with ice cream omitted, and as it falls
to the lot of the charming wives and daughters to dispense the
cordial hospitality for which American farmers are famous, a
few choice recipes are presented here for their consideration.
The ice crusher illustrated in <a href="#il_93">Fig. 93</a> is very convenient for
breaking ice for the freezer or for iced drinks. It is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
improvement over the common method of breaking the ice in
a bag with a mallet.</p>

<p>Recipes for ices are not numerous, because many dainties
are compounded by secret formulas for which confectioners
sometimes have to pay dearly. Again, one who knows how to
make good, plain, old-fashioned ice cream, generally knows
how to add the different fruits and flavors. But the following
have been compiled with great care, many of them are new or
heretofore secret, and they are sufficient in number to give the
housewife, caterer or confectioner every possible delicacy in
the way of ices, exclusive of intoxicating drinks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ice Creams and Ices.</span>—Pour the mixture to be frozen
into the tin can; put beater in this and put on cover. Place in
the tub, being careful to have the point on the bottom fit into
the socket in the tub. Put on the cross piece, and turn the
crank, to see that everything is right. Next comes the
packing. Ice should be broken in large pieces, put into a canvas
bag and pounded fine with a mallet, or put in a tub and
shaved fine with the ice shaver. Put a thick layer of it into
the tub, then a good layer of coarse salt; continue this till the
tub is full; pack down solid with paddle or common stick.
After turning the crank a few times add more salt and ice,
and pack down again, till the tub is full. For a gallon can
three pints of salt and, perhaps, ten quarts of fine ice, will be
required. The water must not be let off, as it is one of the
strongest elements to help the freezing. If more salt than the
quantity given is used the cream will freeze sooner, but will
not be so smooth and rich as when less is used. Turn the
crank for twenty minutes, not so fast at first, but very rapidly
the last ten minutes. It will be hard to turn when the mixture
is frozen. Let off the water carefully, turn back the cross piece,
wipe the salt and water from the cover, take off cover,
not displacing the can itself. Remove the beater and scrape
the cream from it. Work a large spoon up and down until
the cream is light, and the space left by the beater is filled.
Cover the can, cork up the hole from which the handle of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
beater was taken, add more salt and ice till the can is well
covered; set in a cool place (covered with a bit of old carpet),
until time for serving. It is better for standing a couple of
hours. When ready to serve, dip the can for a few seconds in
hot water, wipe it, and turn on a platter. Rest it for a
moment, and lift a little. If the cream is to be served from a
mould, remove it when you do the beater; fill the mould, and
work the cream up and down with a spoon. This will press
the cream into every part and lighten it. Cover the top of the
mould with a thick white paper, put on tin cover, and bury in
fresh salt and ice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How to Serve Creams and Ices.</span>—Much pride is taken by
good cooks in the way they serve their dainties to their friends.
Creams and ices look prettier served on pretty plates. If these
are lacking, lay a flower on each plate, or in some way beautify
it. A quaint way of serving cream was noticed not long
since. Calla lilies had been robbed of their stamens and their
cups filled with the cream.</p>

<h3>ICE CREAMS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Vanilla Ice Cream.</span>—One quart of rich cream, one cup
of milk, one cup of sugar, one and one-half teaspoonfuls of
vanilla. This recipe nearly doubles itself if the cream is very
rich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strawberry Ice Cream.</span>—One quart of strawberries, one
pint of sugar, one-half pint of milk, one and one-half pints of
cream. Mash the berries and sugar together through a fine
strainer into the freezer, after the rest of the mixture has been
freezing about eight minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown Bread Ice Cream.</span>—Dry the crust of brown bread
in a warm oven. Roll fine and sift. Add one pint of the
crumbs to the preparation for vanilla ice cream. The vanilla
and one-fourth of the sugar must be omitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cocoanut Ice Cream.</span>—One quart of cream, one pint of
milk, three eggs, one and one-half cupfuls of sugar, one cupful
of prepared cocoanut, the rind and juice of one lemon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
Beat together the eggs and grated rind and put with the milk
in a double vessel. Stir till the mixture begins to thicken.
Add the cocoanut and put away to cool. When cold add
sugar, lemon juice and cream. Freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig Ice Cream.</span>—One quart of milk, two tablespoonfuls
of corn starch, one of gelatine, one pint of cream, a cupful
and a half of sugar, three eggs, two cupfuls of figs cut fine,
one tablespoonful of vanilla. Put the milk in a double boiler,
reserving half a cupful. When it is boiling pour in the corn
starch, which has been mixed with the cold milk. Cook ten
minutes. Beat the eggs and sugar together; pour the cooked
mixture on this, stirring all the time. Return to the fire, add
the gelatine, which has been soaking in four tablespoonfuls of
cold water, and cook three minutes. Set away to cool. When
cold add the cream and vanilla, and freeze. When the cream
has been freezing ten minutes, take off cover and stir in the
figs. Cover again and finish freezing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chocolate Ice Cream.</span>—One quart of cream, one pint of
milk, one even pint of powdered sugar, one tablespoonful of
vanilla, six eggs, one teacup grated chocolate. Mix sugar,
chocolate, cream and milk, and bring to the boiling point in a
porcelain kettle; then draw the kettle to the back of the stove,
and stir in the mixture, six yolks and four whites, which have
been beaten separately and together. Draw the kettle forward
again, stir constantly till the mixture looks like thick cream,
then take it from the stove and add the remaining whites,
which have been well beaten. When slightly cooled add
vanilla. When cold pour in freezer and freeze. This quantity
is enough for twelve persons. Chocolate must be dissolved in
a little boiling water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New York Ice Cream.</span>—One full quart of cream, one
coffee cup of powdered sugar, four eggs, three teaspoonfuls of
vanilla. Beat the yolks and whites separately, then put
together and stir in one pint of cream. When it reaches the
boiling point draw cream to back of stove until the whole is
well mixed, then draw forward, stir until it thickens, about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
three minutes. Cool, add the other pint of cream, then the
vanilla. Freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neapolitan Cream.</span>—Make a vanilla, a chocolate and
a strawberry cream; freeze in separate freezers, and fill a
mould the form of a brick in three smooth layers of equal size.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coffee Ice Cream.</span>—Make the same as vanilla, with the
addition of coffee, of which take a cupful ground moderately
fine, put over it just enough water to keep it simmering until
strong, then pour through a bit of cheesecloth, and when cool
into the cream ready for freezing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walnut Ice Cream.</span>—One pint of the meat of walnuts
(American are the best), pounded fine in a mortar, one pint of
milk, one quart of cream, two small cupfuls of sugar, four
eggs and a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt. Beat eggs with
one cupful of sugar; put them and the milk into double boiler
and stir constantly until the mixture begins to thicken. Then
add salt and put away to cool. When cold add the rest of the
sugar, cream and nut meats, and freeze.</p>

  <div class="caption">FIG. 93. ICE CRUSHING MACHINE.</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tea Ice Cream.</span>—One and one-half pints of rich cream, one
pint of sugar, one cup of good strong green tea, yolks of eight
eggs. Mix in inner vessel until it thickens. Strain through
sieve and freeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orange Ice Cream.</span>—One and one-half pints of milk or
cream. One pint of sugar. The rind of two oranges rubbed
on loaf sugar. The juice of six large oranges. Yolks of eight
eggs. A pinch of salt. Mix the ingredients in an inner vessel.
Stir well until the mixture thickens. Pass through fine sieve.
Freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cinnamon Ice Cream.</span>—One and one-half pints of rich
cream. One pint of sugar. Yolks of eight eggs. A good sized
stick of cinnamon, bruised. Cook in inner vessel until mixture
thickens. Strain, cool and freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vanilla Ice Cream.</span>—One and one-half pints cream. One
pint of sugar. One vanilla bean. Yolks of seven eggs, and a
pinch of salt. Break up the bean in the mixture, and proceed
as in Cinnamon Cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Almond Cream.</span>—One pint of cream. One cup of sugar.
One-quarter pound of blanched almonds, well chopped. Stir
over fire, and add well beaten yolks of four eggs. Flavor with
extract of rose. Pour into dish and pile on meringue. Place
on ice until time to serve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tapioca Cream.</span>—Soak two tablespoonfuls of tapioca over
night in just enough water to cover it. In the morning boil
one quart of milk with the soaked tapioca by placing it in a tin
can or pail set in water to boil. Add two-thirds of a cup of
granulated sugar and a pinch of salt. Beat the yolks of three
eggs. When the milk has boiled eight minutes stir in the yolks.
Remove from the fire and stir rapidly for five minutes, so that
it will not curdle. Flavor with vanilla. Pour into pudding
dish. Beat whites well. Pour over the top of cream. Sift
with a little powdered sugar, brown a minute or two in oven.
Serve ice cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swans’ Down Cream.</span>—Whip stiff one put of rich cream.
Beat to a froth the whites of three eggs; sweeten with a small
cup of sugar and flavor with vanilla. Beat all together. Pour
into a glass dish and set into a bowl of crushed ice to send to
table. Eat with sponge cake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peach Ice Cream.</span>—One quart of cream. One cup of milk
sweetened. Whites of three eggs. One pint of sliced peaches.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
As soon as the cream begins to freeze well add the sweetened
peaches which have been run through a sieve. Freeze seven
minutes and add the beaten whites. Freeze well.</p>

<h3>ICED DISHES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lemon Ice.</span>—Eight lemons, two quarts of water, one and
one-half pounds of sugar, whites of four eggs. This makes
three quarts to freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tutti Frutti.</span>—When rich vanilla cream is partly frozen
add English currants, chopped citron, chopped raisins and
candied cherries. The rule is generally the same quantity of
fruit as cream. Mould and place in pounded ice and salt until
ready to serve. A sufficient time must be allowed for the
cream to harden. Blanched almonds chopped fine makes a
nice addition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frozen Pudding.</span>—One generous pint of milk, two cupfuls
of granulated sugar, a scant half cupful of flour, two eggs,
two tablespoonfuls of gelatine, one quart of cream, one pound
of French candied fruit (half a pound will do), four tablespoonfuls
of wine. Let the milk come to a boil, beat the flour, one
cupful of sugar and the eggs, and stir into the boiling milk.
Cook twenty minutes, and add the gelatine, which has been
soaking an hour in enough water to cover it. Set away to
cool. When cold, add wine, sugar and cream. Freeze ten
minutes, then add the candied fruit and finish freezing. When
ready to serve dip tin in warm water, turn out the cream and
serve with whipped cream heaped around.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nesselrode Pudding.</span>—One pint of shelled almonds, one
pint and a half of shelled chestnuts, one pint of cream, a pint
can of pineapple, the yolks of ten eggs, half a pound of French
candied fruit, one tablespoonful of vanilla, four of wine, one
pint of water, one of sugar. Boil the chestnuts half an hour,
then rub off the black skins and pound in a mortar until a
paste. Blanch the almonds and pound in same manner. Boil
the sugar, water and juice from the pineapple for twenty minutes
in a saucepan. Beat the yolks of the eggs and stir them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
into the syrup. Put the saucepan in another of boiling water,
and beat the mixture with an egg beater until it thickens.
Take off, place in basin of cold water, and beat ten minutes.
Mix the almonds and chestnuts with the cream, and rub all
through a sieve. Add the candied fruit and pineapple cut
fine; mix this with cooked mixture; add the flavor and half a
teaspoonful of salt. Freeze the same as ice cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lemon Sherbet.</span>—The juice of five lemons, one pint of
water, one tablespoonful of gelatine. Soak the gelatine in a
little water. Boil one cup of water and dissolve the gelatine
in it. Mix together the sugar, water, gelatine and lemon juice.
Turn into can and freeze. This is light and creamy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lemon Sherbet.</span>—One pint and a half of sugar, three
pints of water, the juice of ten lemons. Boil the sugar and
water together twenty-five minutes. Add the lemon-juice,
strain and freeze. This makes a smooth, rich sherbet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orange Sherbet.</span>—Make the same as lemon sherbet, but
use the juice of twenty oranges instead of ten lemons. Boil
the syrup for this dish thirty minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pineapple Sherbet.</span>—A pint and a half can of pineapple,
or, if fresh fruit is used, one large pineapple, a scant pint of
sugar, a pint of water, one tablespoonful of gelatine. Soak
the gelatine an hour in enough cold water to cover it. Cut
the hearts and eyes from the fruit, chop it fine and add to it
the sugar and juice from the can. Have half the water hot
and dissolve the gelatine in it. Stir this and the cold water
into the pineapple. Freeze. This sherbet will be white and
creamy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strawberry Sherbet.</span>—Two quarts of strawberries, one
pint of sugar, one pint and a half of water, one tablespoonful
of gelatine. Mash the berries and sugar together, and let
them stand two hours. Soak the gelatine in cold water to
cover. Add one pint of water to the berries, and strain. Dissolve
the gelatine in half a pint of boiling water; add this to
the strained mixture, and freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strawberry Sherbet No. 2.</span>—One pint and a half of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
strawberry juice, one pint of sugar, one pint and a half of
water, the juice of two lemons. Boil the water and sugar
together for twenty minutes, add the lemon and strawberry
juice. Strain and freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Raspberry Sherbet.</span>—This sherbet is made the same as
the strawberry. When raspberries are not in season, use the
canned or preserved fruit and a smaller quantity of sugar.
The juice of a lemon or two is always an improvement. This
sherbet can also be made by following the second rule for
strawberry sherbet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Currant Sherbet.</span>—One pint of currant juice, one pint
and a half of water, the juice of one lemon, one pint of sugar,
one tablespoonful of gelatine. Have the gelatine soaked in
cold water and dissolve it in half a pint of boiling water. Mix
it with the pint of cold water, the sugar, lemon and currant
juice, and freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frozen Strawberries.</span>—Two quarts of fresh berries, one
pint of sugar, one quart of water. Boil the water and sugar
together half an hour, then add the berries, and cook fifteen
minutes longer. Let this cool, and freeze. When beater is
taken out add one pint of whipped cream. Preserved fruit
may be used in this case, to each quart of fruit one quart of
water, and freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frozen Raspberries.</span>—Prepare raspberries the same as
strawberries. When cold add the juice of three lemons, and
freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frozen Apricots.</span>—One can of apricots, a generous pint
of sugar, a quart of water, a pint of whipped cream—measured
after being whipped. Cut apricots in small pieces, add sugar
and water, freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frozen Peaches.</span>—One can of peaches, one heaping pint
of granulated sugar, one quart of water, two cupfuls of
whipped cream. Boil sugar and water together for twenty
minutes, then add peaches, and cook twenty minutes longer.
Rub through a sieve, and when cool, freeze. When the beater
is taken out stir in the whipped cream with a spoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biscuit Glace.</span>—One pint of cream whipped to a froth, a
dozen and a half macaroons, three eggs, half a cupful of
water, two-thirds of a cupful of sugar, a teaspoonful of vanilla.
Boil the sugar and water together for half an hour, beat the
eggs and stir into the boiling syrup. Place the saucepan containing
the mixture in another of boiling water, and beat for
eight minutes. Take from the fire, place the saucepan in a
pan of cold water, and beat mixture until cold. Then add
flavor and whipped cream. Stir well and fill paper cases.
Have the macaroons rolled fine and browned. Put a layer of
crumbs on the cream in the cases. Place these in an ice cream
mould, cover well and bury in ice and salt for at least two
hours. Serve on fancy plates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glace Meringue.</span>—One quart of cream, one large cupful
of granulated sugar and six tablespoonfuls of powdered, one
tablespoonful of vanilla, the whites of six eggs, one cupful of
milk, one tablespoonful of gelatine, soaked an hour in four
of cold water. Let the milk come to a boil, and stir the gelatine
into it. Strain into the cream, add the vanilla and granulated
sugar; turn into the tin and freeze. When the mixture
is frozen (it will usually require twenty minutes), take out the
beater and pack the cream smoothly, being careful to have the
top perfectly smooth. Set away until serving time. It should
stand, at least, an hour. When ready to serve, beat the whites
of the eggs to a stiff froth, and gradually beat into this the
powdered sugar. Turn the cream out, and cover every part of
it with the meringue. Brown in a hot oven and serve immediately.
If the dish is flat put a board under it; this keeps the
heat from the bottom. Glace meringue is a beautiful dish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bombe Glace.</span>—One quart of strawberry or raspberry
sherbet, one pint of sugar, one pint and a half of water, the
yolks of eighteen eggs, one large tablespoonful of vanilla.
Boil the sugar and water together twenty minutes, beat the
yolks of the eggs very light. Place the saucepan with the
syrup in another pan of boiling water; stir the eggs into this
syrup and beat with a whisk for ten minutes. Take from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
fire, place the basin in a pan of cold water, and continue beating
for ten or fifteen minutes. Pack an ice cream mould in
ice and salt. Take the sherbet from the freezer and spread on
the sides and bottom of the mould. When it is hard put the
cooked mixture in the center, being careful not to disturb the
sherbet. Cover with a piece of thick white paper. Put on the
cover, and cover the top of the mould with salt and ice.
Bombe glace can be made with any kind of sherbet, having
the center part flavored to correspond with the sherbet. The
handsomest dishes are, of course, made with the brightest
colored sherbets.</p>

rich cream. This makes a very simple and wholesome dish.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Always cook custards in inner vessels, as they are not so apt to
scorch. A frozen custard is a delight in hot weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pineapple Water Ice.</span>—One pound of pineapple, peeled,
sliced and reduced to a pulp by pounding. Rub through a fine
sieve. Wash the dregs with half pint of cold water. Add one

<p><span class="smcap">Blackberry Ice.</span>—Put as many blackberries as you wish
to stew, and sweeten to taste. When done put in a bag and
strain. When cold, freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Macaroni Custard.</span>—Take one quart of milk, set it on to
boil. Mix one-half tablespoonful of butter and three of flour,
and stir into the boiling milk. Beat the yolks of six eggs with
one-half cup of sugar. Stir into the milk, and take from fire
to cool. Flavor with vanilla, then crumble one dozen fresh
macaroons over the top and pile on the meringue. Serve ice
cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boiled Custard.</span>—One quart of milk, two eggs, one tablespoonful

vanilla. Boil milk and sugar, then add starch and eggs well
beaten together. Place on ice before serving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Floating Island.</span>—One quart of milk, four eggs—whites
and yolks beaten separately—four tablespoonfuls of sugar, two
teaspoonfuls vanilla, one-half cup of currant jelly. Heat the
milk to scalding, but not boiling. Beat the yolks, stir into
them the sugar and pour upon them gradually, mixing well a
cup of hot milk. Return to saucepan and boil until it begins
to thicken. Pour into glass dish. Heap upon the top meringue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
of whites whipped very stiff, into which you have beaten the
jelly, a teaspoonful at a time. Serve ice cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanc Mange.</span>—Sweeten one quart of cream and flavor to
suit the taste. Dissolve one tablespoon of gelatine in hot
water and pour into the cream. Set on ice and serve with
whipped cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn Starch Blanc Mange.</span>—Dissolve three tablespoonfuls
of corn starch in one pint of milk. Add three teaspoonfuls of

boiling milk. Flavor to taste. Pour into cup. Serve with
jelly and whipped cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Velvet Blanc Mange.</span>—Two cups of sweet cream. One-half
cup of gelatine dissolved in hot water. One-half cup of
powdered sugar. One small glass of white wine. Flavor with
almond extract. Boil cream, sugar and gelatine until it is
smooth, then take it from the fire and flavor by adding the
wine last. Stir well and put in fancy mould on ice. Serve
with cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lemon Jelly.</span>—To a package of gelatine add one pint of

cheese cloth into fancy moulds. Set on ice, and serve with
rich cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strawberry Ice.</span>—Crush three quarts of strawberries with

Squeeze through a straining bag. Add an equal amount of
water to the juice, and when half frozen add the beaten whites
of three eggs. Any juicy fruit may be prepared in the same
manner, currants and raspberries being especially good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snow Pudding.</span>—Dissolve in one pint of boiling water half
a box of good gelatine. When cold add juice of one lemon and
small cup of sugar. Strain well and add the well beaten

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<h3>ICED BEVERAGES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Iced Coffee.</span>—One quart of strong coffee, one quart of
cream, one and three-fourths of a pint of granulated sugar.
Freeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iced Teas</span> are now served to considerable extent during
warm weather. They are used without milk, and the addition
of sugar serves only to destroy the finer tea flavor. It may be
prepared early in the day, taking care to make it stronger than
when served hot. Place in refrigerator, and when ready to
serve, have crushed ice in the tumblers, which are nicer for
the purpose than cups, as the tea looks pretty poured through
the ice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lemonade.</span>—Juice of half a lemon to each goblet of water.
Sweeten to taste and pour over crushed ice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jelly Water.</span>—Sour jellies dissolved in water make delicious
drinks for fever patients. Best always to boil the jelly in
water, then cool. In this way the jelly does not become lumpy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Cooling Drink.</span>—Pour three quarts of water on an
ounce of cream of tartar. Stir in it the juice of a fresh lemon
and the peel cut in very thin strips without a particle of pulp.
Sweeten to taste. Let stand till cold and clear. Pour off without
disturbing sediment at the bottom. A tumblerful iced is a
pleasant and healthful beverage for a warm day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Egg Lemonade.</span>—White of an egg, juice of one lemon, one
tablespoonful sugar, one tumbler of water. Beat well together.
Serve cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gum Arabic Water.</span>—One teaspoonful gum arabic. One
tumbler cold water. Allow it to stand long enough to dissolve.
Flavor with jelly, lemon, or any fruit syrup.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sago Milk.</span>—Three tablespoonfuls sago, soaked in a cup of
cold water one hour. Add three cups of boiling milk. Sweeten
and flavor to suit taste. Simmer slowly half an hour. Eat
warm. Tapioca milk is prepared in the same manner.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
